    bio = "Hi, Iâ€™m Amrita Kanakaraj! By day, Iâ€™m a globe-trotting adventurer with a knack for finding the best hidden gems (and pastries) in every corner of the world. By night, Iâ€™m a flour-dusted home baker, whipping up decadent treats that make my kitchen smell like a Parisian patisserie. When Iâ€™m not jet-setting or covered in powdered sugar, youâ€™ll find me blogging about my travel misadventures, sharing recipes that even your grandma would approve of, and proving that life is best lived with a suitcase in one hand and a whisk in the other. Join me as I explore the world, one passport stamp and cupcake at a time! ðŸŒŽâœ¨"
