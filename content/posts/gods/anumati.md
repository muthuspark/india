## Anumati: Lunar Goddess of Wealth, Intellect, and Prosperity

### Introduction

Anumati is a Hindu goddess associated with the lunar cycle, wealth, intellect, progeny, spirituality, and overall prosperity. Often depicted with the blackbuck as her vahana (vehicle), Anumati represents permission, approval, and auspicious beginnings. While not as widely recognized as some of the more prominent Hindu deities, Anumati holds significant importance in specific traditions and contexts, particularly those emphasizing the connection between lunar phases and auspiciousness. Her iconography often features symbols associated with both the moon and prosperity, reflecting her multifaceted nature. Her significance lies in her role as a facilitator of positive outcomes and the embodiment of divine grace that bestows blessings upon devotees.

###  Etymology and Names

* **Anumati:** The name "Anumati" is derived from the Sanskrit root "anu-mati," meaning "after thought," "consent," or "approval." It signifies the divine assent and auspicious timing necessary for success and prosperity in various endeavors.

* **Other Names and Titles:** While Anumati is the most common name, she may also be referred to by titles that highlight her different attributes. These titles are not widely standardized, but can include:

    *   **Shubhada:** (Sanskrit) - "Giver of Auspiciousness."
    *   **Vidyadayini:** (Sanskrit) - "Giver of Knowledge."
    *   **Lakshmi-Swarupa:** (Sanskrit) - "Form of Lakshmi," signifying her connection to wealth and prosperity.
    *   **Chandra-devi:** A generic term loosely meaning 'Lunar Goddess'.

The specificity of these titles often depends on regional and sectarian interpretations.

###  Mythological Origins

Mythological origins for Anumati are not found in major Hindu scriptures in the same way as some other prominent deities. Her presence is often more subtle and interwoven into lunar-related narratives. Unlike deities with elaborate birth stories, Anumati's origin is less explicitly defined in traditional mythology. Instead, she is understood to be a manifestation of divine feminine energy closely tied to the moon and its cycles. This association suggests an origin connected to the primordial forces that govern the cosmos, with her role emerging as a benevolent influence associated with favorable timings and opportunities.

*   **Lineage:** Due to her less defined mythological genesis, Anumati's specific lineage is not clearly established in popular Hindu narratives. She is generally considered a manifestation of the divine feminine, possibly associated with Lakshmi or other fertility goddesses. Because of her association with the moon, she is sometimes seen as a counterpart or consort to Chandra, the moon god, although this is not a universally accepted view.

###  Major Scriptures and References

References to Anumati are relatively less frequent than those of other major deities in the Vedas, Upanishads, and Puranas. However, she is mentioned in certain contexts, particularly those dealing with lunar cycles and auspiciousness.

*   **Vedas:** Anumati finds mention in the Rigveda and Atharvaveda, particularly in hymns relating to the moon and its influence on fertility, agriculture, and prosperity. The emphasis is less on her individual identity and more on the power of lunar cycles and their role in ensuring positive outcomes. Specific hymns or verses may invoke Anumati to grant permission for success in endeavors.
*   **Puranas:** While not a central figure in the Puranas, she is mentioned incidentally, often in association with rituals and observances tied to the lunar calendar. References may appear in contexts discussing auspicious timings (Muhurta) for ceremonies and activities.
*   **Epics:** Direct mentions of Anumati are rare in the major epics, the Mahabharata and Ramayana. Her presence is more likely to be implied through the overall importance given to auspicious timings and the lunar calendar, which are considered vital for the success of ventures described in the narratives.
*   **Hymns:** Specific hymns dedicated solely to Anumati are not as prevalent as those dedicated to other major deities. However, certain mantras and prayers that invoke the blessings of the moon may indirectly seek the favor of Anumati as the embodiment of lunar grace and auspiciousness.
