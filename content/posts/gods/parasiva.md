## Parasiva: The Transcendent Shiva

### Introduction

Parasiva represents the ultimate, transcendent aspect of Shiva in Hinduism. It is Shiva beyond all form, name, attribute, and limitation – the unmanifest Absolute, the source and essence of all creation. Unlike other depictions of Shiva, which are readily identifiable and anthropomorphic, Parasiva is formless and unmanifest, existing beyond the realm of human comprehension and sensory experience. It is the unchanging reality underpinning the manifest world and the goal of spiritual realization in Shaivism. The understanding of Parasiva is crucial to comprehending the entirety of Shiva's nature, which includes both the transcendent and immanent aspects.

**Key Attributes:** Transcendent, Unmanifest, Attributeless (Nirguna), Absolute Reality, Unchanging.

**Iconography:** Generally, Parasiva has no iconography. It is represented by emptiness, silence, and in some traditions, by a lingam without features, signifying the absence of form. More abstract symbols like Om are sometimes used.

**Significance:** Parasiva represents the ultimate goal of spiritual practice in Shaivism. Realizing Parasiva implies liberation (moksha) from the cycle of birth and death, achieved through the dissolution of ego and identification with the absolute reality. It is the culmination of the spiritual journey, where the individual Self (Atman) merges with the Supreme Self (Paramatman).

###  Etymology and Names

**Meaning and Origin of the Name:** The name "Parasiva" is a compound word derived from Sanskrit.  "Para" signifies "beyond," "transcendent," or "supreme," while "Siva" refers to the deity Shiva. Therefore, Parasiva literally means "beyond Shiva" or "the transcendent Shiva." It indicates a state of being that surpasses even the highest conceptions of Shiva as a personal God.

**Other Names and Titles:**

*   **Nirguna Brahman:** While often associated with Vedanta, this term meaning "Brahman without attributes" is often used interchangeably with Parasiva.
*   **That Which Cannot Be Named:** Given its transcendence, descriptions often emphasize the limitations of language in defining Parasiva.
*   **Supreme Reality:** This underscores its status as the ultimate, unchanging ground of existence.
*   **Paramatma Shiva:** In certain Shaiva traditions, particularly those emphasizing the non-dualistic nature of reality, this term is used to emphasize the ultimate union of Atman and Shiva.

###  Mythological Origins

Parasiva, being the unmanifest, does not have a traditional "birth" or "manifestation" story in the same way as other deities with defined forms and narratives. Its existence is presupposed as the fundamental ground of being from which everything else originates.

**Lineage:** Because Parasiva is considered the ultimate source, it does not have parents or siblings. It is the origin of all deities, including Shiva in his manifest forms. The relationship between Parasiva and the more anthropomorphic Shiva can be likened to the relationship between the unmanifest potential and its manifest expressions.

###  Major Scriptures and References

References to Parasiva are found throughout Shaiva scriptures, although it may not always be explicitly named as such. Its essence is often alluded to in discussions of the ultimate reality, the nature of Brahman, and the path to liberation.

*   **Agamas:** The Shaiva Agamas, particularly those of the Siddhanta school, discuss Parasiva extensively as the ultimate goal of spiritual practice. These texts outline practices and philosophies that aim to lead the practitioner towards realization of this transcendent state.
*   **Upanishads:** While not explicitly naming "Parasiva," passages describing Brahman without attributes (Nirguna Brahman) can be interpreted as referring to the same concept.  Key Upanishads such as the *Mandukya Upanishad* explore the nature of consciousness and the ultimate reality, which aligns with the understanding of Parasiva.
*   **Tirumurai:** This collection of Tamil Shaiva hymns, particularly the works of Nayanars (Shaiva saints), often expresses the yearning for union with the transcendent Shiva, hinting at the concept of Parasiva.
*   **Shivagamas:** They contain detailed descriptions and explanations about Parasiva's divine attributes.

While specific hymns directly addressed to "Parasiva" may be rare, the spirit of transcendence and the unmanifest Absolute is woven throughout Shaiva literature.

###  Roles and Functions

As the unmanifest Absolute, Parasiva does not have specific cosmic "roles" in the traditional sense of creator, preserver, or destroyer. These functions are typically attributed to Shiva in his manifest forms (Maheshvara), such as Sadashiva.

*   **Source of Existence:** Parasiva is the underlying reality from which all of creation arises and into which it ultimately dissolves. It is the ground of being, the uncaused cause.
*   **Foundation of Dharma:** While not directly involved in enforcing dharma, Parasiva represents the ultimate truth and righteousness upon which ethical principles are based.
*   **Ultimate Goal (Moksha):** Realization of Parasiva is the ultimate aim of spiritual practice, leading to liberation from the cycle of birth and death. It transcends the realm of karma and earthly existence.

###  Avatars and Manifestations

Parasiva, being the formless and unmanifest aspect of Shiva, does not have avatars or incarnations in the traditional sense. Avatars are typically associated with deities who assume specific forms and descend into the world to fulfill a particular purpose. Parasiva remains eternally beyond form and manifestation. However, certain philosophical interpretations might consider aspects of Shiva like Sadashiva to be closer reflections of Parasiva's ultimate nature.

###  Symbols and Iconography

As stated before, Parasiva essentially has no iconography. Its representation is often symbolic:

*   **Absence of Form:** The most common "iconography" is the deliberate lack of any image or representation. This signifies the transcendence and incomprehensibility of Parasiva.
*   **Shivalinga:** In some traditions, the plain, unadorned Shivalinga is used as a symbolic representation, indicating the formless nature of the Absolute.
*   **Space/Akasha:** The vastness and emptiness of space are often used as a metaphor for Parasiva's all-encompassing nature.
*   **Om:** This sacred syllable, representing the sound of creation and the ultimate reality, can also be associated with Parasiva.

###  Temples and Worship

Because Parasiva is formless and beyond representation, there are no specific temples dedicated solely to its worship. Instead, the concept of Parasiva is integrated into the broader Shaiva tradition.

*   **Integration into Shaiva Rituals:** During puja and other rituals dedicated to Shiva, the concept of Parasiva is implicitly invoked when contemplating Shiva's ultimate nature.
*   **Meditation and Contemplation:** Direct worship of Parasiva typically involves meditation and contemplation on its formless nature. This may involve practices such as focusing on the breath, cultivating inner silence, or reflecting on the nature of reality.
*   **Symbolic Representations:** While there are no "Parasiva temples", temples dedicated to Shiva often include symbolic representations and philosophical interpretations that implicitly refer to Parasiva.

###  Cultural Impact

The concept of Parasiva has profoundly influenced various aspects of Indian culture, particularly within the Shaiva tradition.

*   **Influence on Literature and Philosophy:** The idea of a transcendent, unmanifest reality has inspired countless philosophical texts, poems, and hymns. The pursuit of realizing Parasiva has been a central theme in spiritual literature.
*   **Influence on Art and Architecture:** While Parasiva itself cannot be depicted, the aesthetic principles of minimalism and abstraction, often found in Shaiva art and architecture, can be seen as reflecting the desire to hint at the formless Absolute.
*   **Influence on Yoga and Meditation:** The practice of yoga and meditation aims to quiet the mind and transcend the limitations of the ego, which are essential steps in realizing Parasiva.

Parasiva, as an abstract concept, is not typically directly represented in modern media. However, the underlying themes of transcendence, the search for ultimate reality, and the limitations of the ego, which are all related to the understanding of Parasiva, can be found in various works of art and literature.

###  Comparative Theology

The concept of Parasiva can be compared to similar notions of the Absolute or Ultimate Reality in other religious and philosophical traditions.

*   **Brahman (Advaita Vedanta):** In Advaita Vedanta, Brahman is described as the attributeless, non-dual reality that is the source of all existence. This is very similar to the concept of Parasiva.
*   **The Tao (Taoism):** The Tao is the ultimate, unnameable principle that underlies all of reality in Taoism. Like Parasiva, it is beyond human comprehension and description.
*   **The Godhead (Christian Mysticism):** In Christian mysticism, the Godhead refers to the ultimate, unknowable essence of God that is beyond all attributes and manifestations.

In different Hindu traditions:

*   **Shaivism:** Parasiva is central to Shaiva philosophy, representing the ultimate goal of spiritual realization.
*   **Vaishnavism:** While Vaishnavism primarily focuses on Vishnu and his avatars, the concept of Brahman (the ultimate reality) can be interpreted as analogous to Parasiva. However, Vaishnavism often emphasizes the personal aspects of God.
*   **Shaktism:** Shaktism focuses on the Divine Feminine, Shakti. While Shakti is seen as the dynamic power of creation, some Shaktas also acknowledge a transcendent reality beyond Shakti, which can be related to Parasiva.

###  Philosophical Interpretations

Different schools of Hindu philosophy offer varying interpretations of Parasiva and its relationship to the manifest world.

*   **Advaita Vedanta:** Advaita Vedanta identifies Parasiva with Nirguna Brahman, the attributeless absolute reality. The world is seen as an illusion (maya) superimposed on Brahman. The goal is to realize the non-duality of Atman (the individual self) and Brahman.
*   **Shaiva Siddhanta:** Shaiva Siddhanta maintains a distinction between Shiva (in his various forms) and the individual soul (Atman). While emphasizing the importance of devotion and ritual, it also recognizes Parasiva as the ultimate goal, achieved through grace and the removal of impurities (malas).
*   **Kashmir Shaivism:** This non-dualistic school views the entire universe as a manifestation of Shiva's consciousness. Parasiva is seen as the ultimate, undifferentiated reality from which all else arises.

In all these philosophical interpretations, the realization of Parasiva is seen as the ultimate liberation from suffering and the cycle of rebirth. It is achieved through various spiritual practices, including meditation, contemplation, devotion, and self-inquiry. The path to Parasiva is a journey of transcending the limitations of the ego and realizing one's true nature as the Absolute.
