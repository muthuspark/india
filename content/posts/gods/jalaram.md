## Jalaram: A 19th-Century Saint-Deity of Gujarat

### Introduction

Jalaram Bapa (1799-1881), a revered figure primarily worshipped in Gujarat, India, is a unique and relatively modern addition to the pantheon of Hindu deities. He is not mentioned in ancient scriptures like the Vedas or Puranas, distinguishing him from traditionally recognized gods and goddesses. Instead, Jalaram's divinity stems from his extraordinary life of selfless service, particularly his unwavering commitment to feeding the hungry, irrespective of caste, creed, or religion. He is often depicted as a compassionate and humble figure, embodying the ideals of charity, devotion, and selfless action. His iconography typically includes a walking stick (Danda), a bowl for alms (Kamandalu), and often, a picture of his Guru, Bhoja Bhagat. Jalaram's significance lies in his representation of the principles of Karma Yoga and the accessibility of divinity through virtuous living, offering a contemporary model for devotion and social responsibility within Hinduism.

###  Etymology and Names

The name "Jalaram" is derived from the Gujarati language. "Jala" possibly refers to water, a symbol of purity and life, and "Ram" is one of the most popular names of the Hindu deity Rama. Thus, "Jalaram" can be interpreted as "Rama, the water of life," although this interpretation is not universally agreed upon.

Other names and titles by which Jalaram is known include:

*   **Jalaram Bapa:** "Bapa" is a term of endearment and respect, meaning "father" or "respected elder." This title is the most common way devotees address him.
*   **Virpur Na Vala:** Meaning "The Beloved of Virpur," referencing the village in Gujarat where Jalaram resided and conducted his philanthropic activities.
*   **Bhakta Jalaram:** Emphasizing his role as a devotee and a model of devotion.

###  Mythological Origins

Unlike deities described in ancient Hindu texts, Jalaram's origins are firmly rooted in historical fact. He was born on November 4, 1799, in Virpur, Gujarat, India, to Pradhan Thakkar and Rajbai Thakkar, belonging to the Lohana caste. There are no traditional mythological accounts of his divine birth or cosmic lineage. However, his devotees often narrate anecdotes and miracles attributed to him, blurring the lines between historical biography and hagiography.

These narratives typically focus on his early inclination towards spirituality and service, his renunciation of worldly comforts, and his eventual dedication to feeding the needy. There are stories of miraculous occurrences linked to his selfless service, strengthening the belief that he was an embodiment of divine grace.

###  Major Scriptures and References

Jalaram Bapa does not feature in any of the traditional Hindu scriptures such as the Vedas, Upanishads, Puranas, or epics. His story and teachings are primarily transmitted through oral traditions, biographies, and devotional songs (bhajans).

While no single primary source text documents his life, several biographical works have been written about him, including:

*   **Shri Jalaram Bapa Charitra:** Accounts of his life and miracles often presented in Gujarati. These biographical works, though devotional in nature, serve as the primary source of information about his life and teachings.

Devotional songs and hymns praising Jalaram Bapa are also integral to his worship and provide insights into the values and beliefs associated with him.

###  Roles and Functions
