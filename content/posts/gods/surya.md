## Surya: The Radiant Sun God in Hinduism

### Introduction

Surya, the Sun god, is a major deity in Hinduism, revered as the source of light, warmth, and life on Earth. Often depicted riding a golden chariot pulled by seven horses, Surya embodies energy, illumination, and vitality.

He often holds lotus flowers in his hands, symbolizing purity and spiritual awakening.

**Significance in Hinduism:**  Surya holds immense significance in Hinduism, recognized as one of the Adityas, the sons of Aditi, a primordial deity representing infinity. He is worshipped as a visible manifestation of the divine, a tangible representation of the supreme Brahman.  His role in sustaining life makes him a revered deity across various Hindu traditions. Surya is considered a powerful benefactor, bestowing health, prosperity, and spiritual insight upon his devotees.
