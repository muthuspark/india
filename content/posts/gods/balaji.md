## Balaji: An Encyclopedic Overview

** Introduction**

Balaji, a popular epithet for Lord Venkateshwara, is one of the most widely revered forms of Vishnu within Hinduism. He is primarily worshipped in South India, particularly at the Tirumala Venkateswara Temple in Andhra Pradesh, which is one of the wealthiest and most visited religious sites in the world. Balaji embodies the preserving aspect of the Hindu trinity, representing compassion, justice, and the fulfillment of devotees' desires. His iconography is rich with symbolic meaning, and his worship plays a central role in the lives of millions of Hindus.

* **Key Attributes and Iconography:** Balaji is generally depicted standing upright with four arms. In two hands, he holds the Chakra (discus) and Shankha (conch shell), symbolizing cosmic power and divine sound respectively. The other two hands are often in the Varada Mudra (granting boons) and Katyavalambita Mudra (resting on the hip). He is adorned with elaborate jewelry, including a diamond crown, gold ornaments, and flower garlands.
* **Significance in Hinduism:** Balaji is seen as a benevolent protector and grantor of wishes. He represents the compassionate nature of Vishnu, offering solace and guidance to those who seek his blessings. His worship is considered highly auspicious and is believed to bring prosperity, health, and spiritual growth.

** Etymology and Names**

* **Meaning and Origin of the Name:** The name "Balaji" is derived from the Sanskrit words "Bala" meaning child or young, and "Ji" which is a suffix used to show respect and reverence. Thus, Balaji can be understood as the "Revered Child" or "Young Lord." This name highlights the accessible and approachable nature of the deity.
* **Other Names and Titles (with meanings):**
    * **Venkateshwara:** (Also spelled Venkateswara) From Sanskrit "Venkata," the name of a mountain, and "Ishvara," meaning Lord. Thus, "Lord of the Venkata Mountain."
    * **Srinivasa:** "Sri" meaning prosperity and "nivasa" meaning abode. Therefore, "Abode of Prosperity" or "Where prosperity resides."
    * **Govinda:** A common name for Vishnu, referring to his role as a protector of cows (Go). It also signifies the remover of suffering and sorrow.
    * **Perumal:** A Tamil name meaning "Great Lord," widely used in South India.

** Mythological Origins**

* **Birth or Manifestation Stories:** There are multiple stories surrounding the manifestation of Balaji/Venkateshwara. One popular legend narrates that Vishnu, after an argument with Lakshmi, came down to earth and chose the Venkata Hill as his abode. He sought the help of Varahaswami, an avatar of Vishnu, to secure the land.
* **Lineage (e.g., parents, siblings, avatars):** As a form of Vishnu, Balaji is considered to be a manifestation of the Supreme Being. Vishnu's consort is Lakshmi (Sridevi), the goddess of wealth and prosperity. In the Tirumala temple, Lakshmi resides on his chest, symbolizing the union of power and grace. He is considered an avatar of Vishnu and is related to other Vishnu avatars such as Rama, Krishna, and Varahaswami.

** Major Scriptures and References**

* **Mentions in Vedas, Upanishads, Puranas, epics (Mahabharata, Ramayana):** While specific direct mentions of "Balaji" as a distinct deity are less common in the older scriptures, the underlying principle of Vishnu's presence and protection is pervasive. The Vedas and Upanishads lay the foundation for the concept of a supreme, all-pervading reality, often associated with Vishnu.
