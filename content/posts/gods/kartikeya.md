### Introduction

Kartikeya, also widely known as Murugan, Skanda, Subramanya, and several other names, is a prominent Hindu deity revered primarily as the god of war and commander-in-chief of the celestial army.

Kartikeya is typically depicted as a youthful warrior, often riding a peacock (his vahana or vehicle), wielding a spear (vel), and embodying courage, strength, and wisdom. He is venerated as a protector, a guide, and an embodiment of divine power. His significance in Hinduism extends beyond his role as a warrior; he is seen as a symbol of overcoming obstacles, achieving self-realization, and upholding dharma (righteousness).

The name "Kartikeya" is derived from "Krittika," the Pleiades star cluster. According to some traditions, he was nurtured by the six Krittika nymphs (daughters of Brahma) after being born from Shiva's seed. Therefore, he is often referred to as the "son of the Krittikas."
