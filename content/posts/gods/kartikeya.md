### Introduction

Kartikeya, also widely known as Murugan, Skanda, Subramanya, and several other names, is a prominent Hindu deity revered primarily as the god of war and commander-in-chief of the celestial army.

Kartikeya is typically depicted as a youthful warrior, often riding a peacock (his vahana or vehicle), wielding a spear (vel), and embodying courage, strength, and wisdom. He is venerated as a protector, a guide, and an embodiment of divine power. His significance in Hinduism extends beyond his role as a warrior; he is seen as a symbol of overcoming obstacles, achieving self-realization, and upholding dharma (righteousness).
