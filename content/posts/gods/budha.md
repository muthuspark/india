**Key Attributes and Iconography:** Budha is typically represented with a green complexion, symbolizing prosperity and growth. He is usually depicted holding a book, representing knowledge, and sometimes a sword, symbolizing intellect. He is often seated on a lion or a carpet.

**Significance in Hinduism:** Budha holds a prominent position in Hindu astrology and is worshipped for blessings of wisdom, eloquence, and success in business. He is considered benevolent and influences intellectual pursuits, education, and communication skills. Worshipping Budha is believed to mitigate the negative effects of Mercury in a birth chart and enhance positive qualities.
