## Hanuman: The Embodiment of Devotion and Strength

### Introduction

Hanuman, also known as Anjaneya, is one of the most beloved and revered deities in Hinduism. He is celebrated for his unparalleled devotion to Lord Rama, his extraordinary strength, unwavering courage, and selfless service. Often depicted as a monkey-faced humanoid, Hanuman embodies the ideals of *bhakti* (devotion), *shakti* (power), and *buddhi* (wisdom). His iconography typically portrays him as a muscular figure, often carrying the *gada* (mace), a symbol of his might. Hanuman holds a prominent position in the Hindu pantheon, particularly within the Vaishnava tradition, and is venerated as a protector, a source of strength, and a symbol of unwavering faith.

###  Etymology and Names

*   **Hanuman:** The most common name, "Hanuman," is believed to derive from the Sanskrit words "Hanu" (jaw) and "man" (prominent or disfigured). One interpretation suggests that this refers to an incident in his childhood when Indra, the king of gods, struck him with his thunderbolt (Vajra) on the jaw, causing a slight disfigurement. Another explanation links it to the Sanskrit word 'Hanumat' (having large cheeks).
*   **Anjaneya/Anjani Putra:** These names denote his lineage, meaning "son of Anjana." Anjana was his mother, an apsara (celestial nymph) who was cursed to be born as a monkey woman.
*   **Maruti:** This name refers to his father, Vayu, the wind god, also known as Marut. Hence, Maruti means "son of Marut."
*   **Mahaveera:** This title signifies "great hero," highlighting his exceptional bravery and prowess.
*   **Bajrangbali:** A popular epithet, particularly in North India, "Bajrangbali" translates to "strong-bodied one" or "one with a body as strong as Vajra," alluding to his invulnerability.
*   **Kesari Nandan:** Meaning "son of Kesari," Kesari was his adoptive father and Anjana's husband.

###  Mythological Origins

The birth of Hanuman is often attributed to divine intervention. According to the most prevalent narrative, Anjana, after performing intense penance, received a boon from Vayu, the wind god, who impregnated her with his divine energy. This divine energy, combined with the blessings of Shiva, resulted in the birth of Hanuman.

Some Puranic accounts suggest that Anjana was granted a fruit by Agni, the fire god, after she worshipped Shiva. Consuming this fruit led to the conception of Hanuman, who is therefore considered an incarnation of Shiva.

Hanuman has no known siblings in the standard Ramayana narrative. He is regarded as the sole offspring of Anjana and Vayu (or Shiva, depending on the account).
