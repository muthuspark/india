The suffix "ji" is an honorific suffix, signifying respect. Therefore, "Tejaji" can be interpreted as "The Radiant One" or "The Venerable Radiant One." The name likely reflects his perceived spiritual power and heroic nature.

    * **Tejal Dev:** "Dev" means "deity" or "god."
    * **Dhawala Veer:** This title, common in some regions, connects him to a specific clan or lineage.
    * **Gaurakshak:** Meaning "protector of cows," underscoring his role in protecting livestock.

###  Mythological Origins

Tejaji's life story is primarily preserved through oral traditions, folk songs, and local narratives rather than formal written scriptures. The most common version of his birth and life events is as follows:

* **Birth and Early Life:** Tejaji is believed to have been born in the village of Kharnal in Rajasthan during the 11th century AD (though specific dates vary depending on the source). He belonged to a Jat family.

* **Key Mythological Incident: The Snakebite and Boons:** The pivotal moment in Tejaji's legend involves a dramatic encounter with a snake. According to the popular narrative, Tejaji was on his way to rescue cows that had been stolen from his village. During his journey, he encountered a snake that was about to be burned in a forest fire. Tejaji, valuing all life, rescued the snake from the flames.

   As gratitude, the snake intended to bite him. However, Tejaji, bound by his duty to rescue the cows, requested the snake to wait until he had completed his mission. He promised to return and allow the snake to bite him.

   After successfully retrieving the cows and fulfilling his promise, Tejaji returned to the snake. He was covered in injuries sustained during the battle to retrieve the cows. Finding no uninjured part of his body, Tejaji offered his tongue for the snake to bite.

   Impressed by Tejaji's courage, honesty, and selflessness, the snake bit his tongue, imbuing him with divine powers. This act transformed Tejaji into a protector against snake venom. It is believed that anyone bitten by a snake can be cured by invoking Tejaji's name and tying a thread in his name.
