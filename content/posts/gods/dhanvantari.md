## Dhanvantari: The Divine Physician and God of Ayurveda

### Introduction

Dhanvantari is a revered Hindu deity and an avatar of Vishnu, primarily recognized as the god of Ayurveda, the traditional Indian system of medicine. He is considered the divine physician who emerged during the churning of the cosmic ocean (Samudra Manthana), carrying the nectar of immortality (Amrita). Dhanvantari embodies the principles of healing, health, and longevity, and is deeply venerated by practitioners of Ayurveda and those seeking physical and spiritual well-being. His iconography typically depicts him as a handsome figure holding a pot of Amrita, symbolizing the power to alleviate suffering and grant eternal life. Dhanvantari's significance in Hinduism lies in his role as the upholder of health and the dispeller of disease, representing a divine force dedicated to the welfare of humanity.

###  Etymology and Names

*   **Dhanvantari:** The name "Dhanvantari" is derived from the Sanskrit words *Dhanvan* meaning "bow" or "archer," and *Tari* meaning "deliverer" or "rescuer." However, a more common interpretation links the name to *Dhanus* (the act of bow making or holding the bow), implying proficiency and skill, further associating him with mastery and divine competence. It suggests Dhanvantari as one who delivers or rescues through his expertise and mastery over healing.

*   **Other Names and Titles:**

    *   **Sudhamurti:** "One who holds the nectar of immortality (Sudha)".
    *   **Amritakalasha Hastam:** "The one who holds the pot (Kalasha) of Amrita in his hand."
    *   **Ayurveda Devata:** "The deity of Ayurveda."
    *   **Devaraja:** This term translates to "King of the Gods" highlighting his stature among the celestial beings and as a divine manifestation of Lord Vishnu.

###  Mythological Origins

Dhanvantari's birth or manifestation is primarily associated with the Samudra Manthana, the churning of the cosmic ocean, a prominent narrative in Hindu mythology.

*   **Samudra Manthana:** According to the Puranas, the Devas (gods) and Asuras (demons) collaborated to churn the ocean of milk (Kshira Sagara) to obtain Amrita. As the churning progressed, various divine objects and beings emerged, including Lakshmi (the goddess of prosperity), the celestial elephant Airavata, and finally, Dhanvantari. He rose from the ocean holding a pot filled with Amrita, signifying his role as the divine physician and bestower of immortality. The struggle for the nectar between the Devas and Asuras led to further events, but Dhanvantari's appearance marked a turning point in the quest for eternal life and well-being.

*   **Lineage:** Dhanvantari is considered an avatar of Vishnu, one of the principal deities in the Hindu trinity (Trimurti). While the details of his parentage in this particular avatar are less emphasized compared to other avatars of Vishnu like Rama or Krishna, his connection to Vishnu establishes his divine lineage and reinforces his role as a preserver and protector of life. Some texts also refer to him as a descendant of Bharadwaja, a renowned sage and scholar, further linking him to the lineage of Ayurvedic knowledge and wisdom. He is sometimes considered a son of Dirghatamas, a Vedic sage.
