## Dharma: The Embodiment of Righteousness and Cosmic Order

### Introduction

Dharma, often translated as righteousness, duty, or cosmic order, is a central concept in Hinduism and also personified as a deity. He embodies the principles of morality, law, and order that uphold the universe. As a god, Dharma represents the ideal conduct and righteous path that individuals should strive to follow. His influence extends beyond individual behavior to encompass societal harmony and the proper functioning of the cosmos.

**Key Attributes and Iconography:** Dharma's iconography varies, but he is often depicted as a wise and serene figure, sometimes adorned in white or golden robes, symbolizing purity and truth. He may be shown with a book or scroll, representing the scriptures and moral law, or holding a lotus, signifying spiritual awakening. He is sometimes associated with animals known for their righteousness, such as the bull.

**Significance in Hinduism:** Dharma is one of the four Purusharthas, or aims of human life in Hinduism, the others being Artha (wealth), Kama (desire), and Moksha (liberation). Dharma provides the framework for living a meaningful and fulfilling life, guiding individuals towards moral and spiritual growth. Adherence to Dharma is believed to lead to positive Karma and ultimately, to Moksha, the liberation from the cycle of birth and death.

###  Etymology and Names

**Meaning and Origin of the Name:** The word "Dharma" originates from the Sanskrit root *dhṛ*, meaning "to hold, maintain, or preserve." Thus, Dharma literally signifies that which holds things together, that which sustains and supports the universe and its inhabitants.

**Other Names and Titles (with meanings):**

*   **Dharmaraja:** "King of Dharma" - Emphasizes his role as the ultimate judge and enforcer of righteous conduct.
*   **Yama:** While primarily known as the god of death, Yama is considered a son of Surya (the sun god) and Saranyu, and is intimately linked to Dharma, acting as a righteous judge of the deceased. In some traditions, Yama is considered an avatar of Dharma.
*   **Dharma-devata:** "The deity of Dharma" -  A general term referring to the deified aspect of Dharma.

###  Mythological Origins

**Birth or Manifestation Stories:**  The specific birth story of Dharma varies depending on the text and tradition. He is sometimes described as having emerged from Brahma, the creator god, signifying his inherent role in the creation and maintenance of the cosmos. Another common origin story identifies him as the son of Brahma born from his right breast (righteousness).

**Lineage (e.g., parents, siblings, avatars):**  As mentioned, Dharma is often considered the son of Brahma. In some accounts, he is the father of Yama, the god of death, through his union with the goddess Samjna (or Saranyu). Dharma also has many children (considered embodiments of righteous qualities or virtues) through various unions with other deities. For example, the Pandava brother, Yudhishthira, from the epic Mahabharata, is often regarded as an offspring of Dharma.
