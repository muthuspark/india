Represented as a white bull, often depicted reclining and facing the inner sanctum of Shiva temples, Nandi embodies strength, devotion, and righteousness. He is more than just a vehicle; Nandi is considered a devotee and eternal companion of Shiva, symbolizing the perfect disciple and the embodiment of dharma. His presence is considered auspicious, and his image is a ubiquitous feature in Shiva temples throughout the Indian subcontinent and beyond.

** Mythological Origins**

Shilada, desiring immortality, performed intense penance to Lord Shiva. Shiva, pleased with his devotion, granted Shilada a son who would be immortal. Thus, Nandi emerged from a sacrificial fire. Another version suggests that Nandi was found by Shilada in a field while ploughing, blessed by Shiva and subsequently raised as his son.
