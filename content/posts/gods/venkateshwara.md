## Venkateshwara: The Lord of the Seven Hills

### Introduction

Venkateshwara, also known as Srinivasa, Balaji, and Venkatachalapati, is a prominent form of Vishnu, the preserver of the universe in the Hindu trinity (Trimurti). He is primarily worshipped at the Tirumala Venkateswara Temple in Andhra Pradesh, India, one of the most visited and wealthiest religious sites in the world. Venkateshwara is revered as the supreme deity, embodying divine grace and bestowing boons upon his devotees. He is often depicted as a dark-complexioned, youthful figure adorned with opulent jewels and standing in a posture that symbolizes granting wishes and protection. Venkateshwara's significance lies in his role as a compassionate and accessible deity who fulfills the desires of his devotees while guiding them towards spiritual liberation.

Key attributes include his association with wealth, prosperity, and the removal of obstacles. His iconography reflects these attributes, featuring symbols of power, sovereignty, and divine beauty. His presence is deeply intertwined with the concept of *dharma* (righteous conduct) and *moksha* (liberation).

###  Etymology and Names

**Meaning and Origin of the Name:**

The name "Venkateshwara" is derived from two Sanskrit words: "Venkata" and "Ishwara." "Venkata" refers to the Venkata Hills (also known as the Seshachala Hills), where the Tirumala temple is located. "Ishwara" means "Lord" or "Supreme Being." Therefore, Venkateshwara literally translates to "Lord of the Venkata Hills."

**Other Names and Titles:**

Venkateshwara is known by numerous names and titles, each carrying its own significance:

*   **Srinivasa:** This name signifies "abode of Lakshmi (Sri)," indicating that Lakshmi, the goddess of wealth and prosperity, resides in him.
*   **Balaji:** This term is a popular and affectionate name, meaning "young lord" or "child lord," reflecting his youthful appearance and approachable nature.
*   **Venkatachalapati:** Meaning "Lord of Venkatachala," further emphasizing his connection to the sacred hills.
*   **Govinda:** One of Vishnu's thousand names, this name means "protector of cows" or "the one who gives pleasure."
*   **Saptagiri Vasa:** "The one who resides on the seven hills," a direct reference to the location of the Tirumala temple.

###  Mythological Origins

**Birth or Manifestation Stories:**

Several mythological narratives describe the origin of Venkateshwara. The most prevalent story involves a quarrel between Lakshmi and Saraswati, the consorts of Vishnu and Brahma respectively. Upset by the conflict, Vishnu left Vaikuntha, his divine abode, and descended to earth, taking refuge in an anthill on the Venkata Hills. Lakshmi, concerned for her husband, informed him that he was a poor Brahmin and should go to the king to seek help in his financial woes.

Lakshmi then informed the King of the story, who then offered to give all the wealth he had to his debt to Kubera, Lord of wealth. Lakshmi explained that she was hidden as a cow and calf and that he should offer both of them to the Lord. The Lord blessed the King and said that he would reside there forever.

**Lineage:**

Venkateshwara is considered an avatar of Vishnu, making his lineage directly traceable to the primordial god. Vishnu's parents are typically considered to be Ksheerasagara (the cosmic ocean) and Lakshmi. His siblings include other avatars like Rama and Krishna. As an avatar, Venkateshwara inherits Vishnu's divine attributes and powers.

###  Major Scriptures and References

###  Philosophical Interpretations
