## Shantadurga: The Peaceful Form of Durga

### Introduction

Shantadurga, also known as Santeri, is a prominent Hindu goddess primarily worshipped in Goa, India. She represents a unique synthesis of power (Shakti) and peace (Shanti), embodying a form of Durga who pacifies conflict and restores harmony. Unlike the often fierce and warrior-like depictions of Durga in other regions, Shantadurga is typically represented in a serene and benevolent form, often associated with motherhood and protection. She is revered as a powerful yet compassionate deity, a protector of her devotees and a symbol of reconciliation.

*   **Key Attributes and Iconography:** Shantadurga is usually depicted standing on a pedestal, often with four arms, holding symbols of both strength and tranquility. She is sometimes shown riding a lion, indicative of her power, but her facial expression remains calm and composed. The typical iconography also includes a shivalinga, highlighting her connection with Shiva, and weapons, symbolizing her capability to protect.
*   **Significance in Hinduism:** Within the broader framework of Hinduism, Shantadurga is considered an aspect of Parvati, the consort of Shiva and the embodiment of Shakti. Her worship emphasizes the importance of maintaining inner peace and resolving conflicts through diplomacy rather than aggression, a principle valued within Hindu philosophy. She is seen as a bridge between opposing forces, a facilitator of balance and harmony in the cosmos and in individual lives.

###  Etymology and Names

*   **Meaning and Origin of the Name:** The name "Shantadurga" is a compound of two Sanskrit words: "Shanta," meaning "peaceful," "calm," or "serene," and "Durga," referring to the principal Hindu goddess, a form of Parvati, associated with power and protection. Thus, Shantadurga literally translates to "Peaceful Durga." The name reflects her primary attribute â€“ her ability to maintain peace and resolve conflicts.
*   **Other Names and Titles:**
    *   **Santeri:** This is a common local name for Shantadurga, particularly in Goa. The etymology is debated, but it is believed to be a derivative of "Shanta" or a localized term for a female deity associated with peace and prosperity.
    *   **Vijayadurga:** While some consider Vijayadurga a distinct form, she is often associated with Shantadurga. "Vijaya" means "victory," suggesting a triumphant aspect, but this victory is often interpreted as overcoming internal conflicts and external obstacles through peaceful means.
    *   **Aryadurga:** Arya meaning noble, is used as a prefix to Durga, and is often found in temple names associated with Shantadurga.

###  Mythological Origins

The specific mythological stories regarding Shantadurga are largely localized and vary between regions and temples. A prevalent legend associated with Shantadurga's manifestation highlights her role as a peacemaker.

*   **Birth or Manifestation Stories:** A common Goan legend tells of a conflict between Shiva and Vishnu, two of the principal deities of the Hindu trinity. Their intense battle threatened to destroy the world. To avert this catastrophe, Parvati intervened, manifesting as Shantadurga. She placed herself between Shiva and Vishnu, pacifying them and restoring harmony to the universe. This narrative underscores her role as a mediator and a symbol of reconciliation.
*   **Lineage:** Shantadurga is considered an aspect or manifestation of Parvati, the consort of Shiva. As Parvati, she is the daughter of Himavat, the king of the Himalayas, and Mena. She is the sister of the river goddess Ganga and is often associated with other forms of Durga, such as Kali and Lakshmi. However, Shantadurga emphasizes the peaceful aspects of Shakti, providing a counterbalance to the more ferocious manifestations.

###  Major Scriptures and References

*   **Mentions in Vedas, Upanishads, Puranas, epics:** While Shantadurga, as a specific localized form, is not explicitly named in the Vedas or early Upanishads, the concept of Shakti and the divine feminine is deeply embedded in these texts. The Devi Mahatmyam, a part of the Markandeya Purana, extensively describes the glory and power of Durga, providing a foundation for the later development of localized forms like Shantadurga. The Shakta Upanishads, such as the Devi Upanishad, celebrate the supremacy of the Devi and provide philosophical underpinnings for her worship.
*   **Primary source texts or hymns:** There are specific hymns and prayers dedicated to Shantadurga, often composed in local languages like Konkani and Marathi. These hymns praise her peaceful nature, her protective qualities, and her role as a mediator. Stotras, specific prayers for the deity are also used in daily worship. While there isn't one single definitive text, temple-specific records and oral traditions preserve the rituals and hymns associated with Shantadurga worship.

###  Roles and Functions

*   **Cosmic roles:** While not typically assigned the role of creator, Shantadurga is primarily viewed as a preserver and a protector. She maintains cosmic balance by pacifying conflicts and ensuring harmony prevails. Her role extends to protecting her devotees from negative influences and guiding them towards spiritual growth.
*   **Association with dharma, karma, moksha:** Shantadurga's emphasis on peace and harmony aligns with the principles of Dharma, righteous conduct, especially the aspect of Ahimsa or non-violence.

Her benevolent nature fosters devotion (Bhakti), considered an essential path to enlightenment in Hindu philosophy.

###  Avatars and Manifestations

While Shantadurga is considered a manifestation of Durga, she is not typically associated with a traditional list of avatars in the same way Vishnu is. Her different temple forms, such as Vijayadurga, can be seen as variations highlighting different aspects of her power and grace, rather than distinct avatars. The core essence remains the same: a powerful force for peace and protection.
