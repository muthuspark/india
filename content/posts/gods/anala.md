    * **Shaktism:** In Shaktism, Agni is often associated with the power of Shakti (divine feminine energy), particularly in the form of Kundalini, the serpent fire that rises through the chakras.

###  Philosophical Interpretations

* **How the deity is interpreted by different schools of Hindu philosophy (Vedanta, Samkhya, Bhakti, etc.):**
    * **Vedanta:** Vedanta emphasizes the unity of Atman (individual soul) and Brahman (universal consciousness). Anala/Agni is seen as a manifestation of Brahman, representing the underlying energy and consciousness that permeates all of existence.
    * **Samkhya:** Samkhya philosophy distinguishes between Purusha (consciousness) and Prakriti (matter). Fire, as a material element, falls under the realm of Prakriti but also embodies energy and transformation, reflecting the dynamic interaction between Purusha and Prakriti.
    * **Bhakti:** In Bhakti traditions, devotion and love are the primary paths to spiritual realization. While Anala/Agni is less central to Bhakti compared to deities like Vishnu or Shiva, the act of offering into the fire with devotion is considered a form of surrender and connection to the divine.
* **Role in spiritual practices and metaphysical ideas:** Anala/Agni's role in spiritual practices is deeply rooted in the concept of purification and transformation. Meditating on the nature of fire, performing fire sacrifices, and understanding the symbolic meaning of flames can lead to spiritual insights and a deeper connection to the divine. Metaphysically, fire represents the dynamic and transformative energy that underlies all of existence, bridging the material and spiritual realms.
