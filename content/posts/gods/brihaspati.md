## Brihaspati: The Divine Preceptor and God of Wisdom

### Introduction

Brihaspati, also known as Guru, is a significant deity in Hinduism, revered as the preceptor (teacher or guru) of the gods (Devas) and a personification of wisdom, eloquence, and righteousness. He holds a prominent place in Hindu cosmology and religious practice. He is often associated with the planet Jupiter (Guru Graha) and is considered highly auspicious. Brihaspati is a vital figure in guiding the deities and ensuring the proper functioning of the cosmic order.

* **Key Attributes and Iconography:** Brihaspati is typically depicted as a wise and benevolent figure with a golden or yellowish complexion. He is often portrayed as an older man with a long beard, symbolizing his vast experience and knowledge. He is commonly shown holding a rosary (mala), a water pot (kamandalu), and a staff (danda).
* **Significance in Hinduism:** Brihaspati's significance stems from his role as the guide and advisor to the gods. His wisdom is crucial for maintaining balance in the universe and resolving conflicts between the gods and demons. He is also invoked for blessings of wisdom, knowledge, prosperity, and success. His day of worship is Thursday (Guruvar or Brihaspativar), considered auspicious for seeking his blessings.

###  Etymology and Names

* **Meaning and Origin of the Name:** The name "Brihaspati" is derived from the Sanskrit words "Brihat" (meaning great or expansive) and "Pati" (meaning lord or master). Thus, Brihaspati translates to "Lord of Greatness" or "Lord of Prayers." The name suggests his dominion over knowledge, wisdom, and spiritual power.

* **Other Names and Titles (with meanings):** Brihaspati is known by several other names and titles, each highlighting a specific aspect of his divine nature:
    * **Guru:**  Simply means "teacher" or "preceptor," emphasizing his role as the guide of the gods.
    * **Vachaspati:** "Lord of Speech" or "Master of Eloquence," highlighting his mastery of language and communication.
    * **Devejya:** "The one who is worshipped by the gods," signifying his importance and reverence amongst the deities.
    * **Suraguru:** "Teacher of the Gods," another common appellation.
    * **Angirasa:** Sometimes used as a synonym, referencing his lineage (explained below). While Angirasa is a Rishi, Brihaspati is considered his son.

###  Mythological Origins

* **Birth or Manifestation Stories:** Brihaspati's birth stories vary across different Puranas. One common narrative identifies him as the son of the sage Angiras and his wife Smriti. Another account claims he emerged directly from the mouth of Brahma, the creator god. These diverse accounts underscore his divine origin and inherent wisdom.

* **Lineage (e.g., parents, siblings, avatars):** Brihaspati is primarily recognized as the son of Rishi Angiras and Smriti. His lineage is significant because Angiras is one of the Saptarishis (seven great sages), emphasizing Brihaspati's connection to ancient wisdom. He is married to Tara, who, in some legends, is abducted by Chandra (the Moon god), leading to a celestial war. Their son, Budha (the planet Mercury), is born from this union, further connecting Brihaspati to the planetary deities. There are no widely recognized avatars or incarnations of Brihaspati.
