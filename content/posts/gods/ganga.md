### Introduction

Ganga, revered as a goddess in Hinduism, is the personification of the Ganges River, the most sacred river in India. She is a prominent deity, deeply embedded in the religious, cultural, and spiritual fabric of the Indian subcontinent. Ganga is venerated for her purifying powers, her ability to wash away sins, and her association with liberation (moksha).

Sometimes, she is depicted with four arms, symbolizing her multifaceted nature.

**Significance in Hinduism:** Ganga holds immense significance in Hinduism. She is considered a mother goddess, a source of life, sustenance, and spiritual purification.
