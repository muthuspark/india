## Arundhati: Embodiment of Virtue and Constancy

** Introduction**

Arundhati is a revered figure in Hinduism, primarily recognized as the wife of the esteemed sage Vashishta. She is not considered a goddess in the traditional sense, but rather a woman of exceptional virtue, devotion, and unwavering fidelity. She is intrinsically linked to the Saptarishi, the seven great sages, and is often identified with the morning star and the Alcor star, a faint companion star to Mizar in the constellation Ursa Major (the Big Dipper). Arundhati serves as an exemplar of marital devotion, chastity, and asceticism, making her a significant figure in Hindu traditions relating to marriage, family, and spiritual life. While not receiving widespread temple worship, her veneration lies in the symbolic representation of ideal womanhood and the invocation of her name in marriage rituals.

**Key Attributes and Iconography:** Arundhati's key attributes are her unwavering fidelity, profound wisdom, and exceptional ascetic power (tapas). Iconographically, she is rarely depicted independently but is usually shown alongside her husband, Vashishta. She is typically portrayed as a simple, modest woman, dressed in saffron or white robes, reflecting her ascetic lifestyle.

**Significance in Hinduism:** Arundhati holds a prominent place in Hinduism, symbolizing ideal womanhood, marital fidelity, and the power of asceticism. Her life story serves as an inspiration for women, emphasizing the importance of devotion, duty, and unwavering commitment to one's spouse. Her presence in marriage rituals and her association with the celestial realm highlight her esteemed status and enduring influence.

** Etymology and Names**

**Meaning and Origin of the Name:** The name "Arundhati" is derived from Sanskrit. The etymology is debated, but a common interpretation connects it to the root words "arundha" (obstructed, uncontrolled) and "ati" (to go beyond, surpass). This suggests that Arundhati is someone who transcends obstacles and limitations through her unwavering devotion and ascetic power.  Another interpretation links "Arundhati" to the color red or dawn, potentially signifying her connection to the morning star and the auspiciousness of a new beginning.

**Other Names and Titles:** While Arundhati doesn't have numerous alternative names, she is often referred to by epithets reflecting her qualities and relationship to Vashishta:

*   **Vashishta-patni:** Wife of Vashishta. This title emphasizes her marital status and her inseparable bond with the sage.
*   **Sati:**  This term denotes a virtuous and chaste woman, a description closely associated with Arundhati. Although not her specific name, it signifies her inherent quality.
*   She is also sometimes implicitly referred to as one of the Saptamatrika – the seven divine mothers, due to her association with the Saptarishi.

** Mythological Origins**

**Birth or Manifestation Stories:**  Unlike many deities, Arundhati's birth story is not consistently detailed across different Puranas.  Some texts suggest she was born a mortal woman who attained extraordinary spiritual merit through her devotion to Vashishta and her ascetic practices.  Other versions hint at a more divine origin, linking her to the creation myths but without offering precise details. One notable narrative describes her as being born from the ashes of Sati Anasuya’s sacrificial fire, embodying her purity and devotion.

**Lineage:**  Arundhati is not typically portrayed as having direct parents or siblings in the same way as other Hindu deities. Her significance lies in her marriage to Vashishta and her role as the matriarch of his lineage.
