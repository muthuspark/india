### **Introduction**

Located in Chittorgarh, Rajasthan, India, the fort sprawls over 691 acres (2.8 km²), making it one of the largest forts in India. It's situated approximately 112 kilometers (70 miles) east of Udaipur, a major tourist hub. The fort's strategic location played a significant role in its history, witnessing numerous sieges and battles, earning it a reputation for resilience and a symbol of Rajput pride.  The fort's unique charm lies in its rich history, stunning architecture, and the numerous historical sites within its formidable walls, each echoing tales of bravery and resilience.

### **History and Cultural Heritage**

The history of Chittorgarh Fort is interwoven with the saga of the Sisodia dynasty, a prominent Rajput clan. While the exact origins are debated, the fort's history dates back to the 7th century AD. The fort changed hands multiple times, witnessing sieges by various invaders including the Delhi Sultanate and the Mughals.  The fort is particularly famous for its three Jauhars (mass self-immolation by Rajput women to avoid capture and dishonor by the invading forces). These Jauhars are etched in history as symbols of the Rajput's unwavering resolve to uphold their honor even in the face of defeat. The most notable Jauhars occurred in 1303, led by Rani Padmini during the siege by Alauddin Khilji; in 1535, during the siege by Bahadur Shah of Gujarat; and in 1567 during the siege by Akbar.
