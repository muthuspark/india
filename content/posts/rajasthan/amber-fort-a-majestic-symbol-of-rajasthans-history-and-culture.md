### **Introduction**

Amber Fort, also known as Amer Fort, is a majestic fortress located in Amber, about 11 kilometers (7 miles) from Jaipur, the Pink City of Rajasthan, India. Situated atop a high hill, overlooking Maota Lake, the fort is renowned for its stunning architecture, historical significance, and captivating views.

### **History and Cultural Heritage**

The Amber Fort has a long and fascinating history, dating back to the 16th century. Originally constructed by the Meenas, the fort was later ruled by the Kachwaha Rajputs. Raja Man Singh I, one of Akbar's most trusted generals, began construction in 1592, and his successors expanded and renovated it over the following 150 years. The fort served as the primary residence of the Rajput rulers of the Amber kingdom until Jaipur was established as the new capital.

The fort reflects a blend of Rajput and Mughal architectural influences. The intricate carvings, delicate mirror work (Shish Mahal), and imposing structures showcase the artistic sensibilities of the period. The fort played a significant role in defending the kingdom against invaders, serving as a vital military stronghold and a symbol of Rajput power. The annual Amber Fort Festival, held around March, celebrates the cultural heritage of the region with traditional music, dance performances, and processions. The fort is also a site of religious significance, with numerous temples dedicated to various deities, including Shila Devi.
