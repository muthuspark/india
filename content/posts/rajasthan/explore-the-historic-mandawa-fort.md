Located approximately 170 kilometers (105 miles) from Jaipur, it sits at an elevation of around 300 meters (980 feet) above sea level. Mandawa’s allure lies in its beautifully preserved havelis (mansions) adorned with intricate frescoes, depicting mythological tales, royal processions, and scenes from everyday life. These stunning architectural marvels offer a glimpse into the rich history and cultural heritage of the Marwari merchants who once thrived in this region. Its unique charm lies in its ability to transport visitors back in time, offering an authentic experience of the royal Rajasthani lifestyle.

### **History and Cultural Heritage**

Mandawa's history is deeply intertwined with the rise of the Marwari merchants during the 18th and 19th centuries. These prosperous traders, seeking a strategic location for their trading activities, established Mandawa as a significant trading outpost along the ancient Silk Route. The havelis, which are the defining characteristic of Mandawa, were built by these wealthy merchants to showcase their wealth and status. Each haveli is a testament to their prosperity, featuring stunning frescoes, elaborate carvings, and intricate mirror work.

The cultural fabric of Mandawa is rich with Rajasthani traditions, including vibrant festivals like Teej, Gangaur, and Holi.
