### **History and Cultural Heritage**

The Kagyu Monastery in Dehradun is relatively modern, established in the late 20th century as a center for the practice and propagation of the Kagyu lineage of Tibetan Buddhism. It serves as a vital cultural link for the Tibetan diaspora in India and offers a place of worship, learning, and community for Buddhists and those interested in Tibetan culture.
