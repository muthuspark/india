### **Introduction**

Tehri Dam, located in New Tehri, Uttarakhand, India, is not just a marvel of engineering but also a gateway to the stunning landscapes of the Garhwal Himalayas. Situated at a high altitude, this colossal dam is nestled amidst picturesque mountains and offers breathtaking views of the turquoise waters of the Tehri Lake. New Tehri, the planned town that arose to accommodate those displaced by the dam's construction, is perched at an elevation of approximately 1,750 meters (5,740 feet) above sea level. It is easily accessible from popular destinations like Rishikesh (around 75 km) and Dehradun (about 100 km), making it a convenient stop for travelers exploring Uttarakhand. The dam itself is the tallest in India and one of the tallest in the world, creating a vast reservoir that reshaped the landscape. This makes Tehri Dam a unique destination combining natural beauty with the awe-inspiring scale of human achievement.

### **History and Cultural Heritage**

The history of the Tehri Dam is deeply intertwined with the local culture and the socio-economic changes it brought. The idea for the dam was conceived in the early 1960s, but construction began in 1978 and faced several delays and controversies due to environmental concerns and the displacement of local populations. The completion of the dam in 2006 led to the submergence of the old Tehri town, along with numerous villages and historical sites. The displacement required resettlement efforts, leading to the development of New Tehri.

The cultural impact has been significant. While the dam is a symbol of modern progress, it also carries the weight of lost heritage. The traditions and ways of life of the people who were relocated have undergone considerable transformation. Festivals and cultural events, while still celebrated, are now centered in New Tehri. The region is known for its vibrant Garhwali culture, evident in its music, dance, and traditional attire. Pilgrimage sites like the Chandrabadni Temple, located nearby, continue to hold religious and spiritual significance, attracting devotees and offering a glimpse into the region's rich cultural heritage.

The dam itself is a dramatic sight, with the immense reservoir of Tehri Lake stretching for miles, surrounded by the imposing peaks of the Garhwal Himalayas. The area's landscape is characterized by rugged terrain, verdant valleys, and dense forests, creating a visual symphony of nature.
