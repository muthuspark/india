Located at an impressive elevation of 2,800 meters (9,200 feet) above sea level, Auli offers breathtaking panoramic views of the towering snow-capped peaks of Nanda Devi, Kamet, and Dronagiri. Its pristine slopes and well-maintained ski runs have made it a popular alternative to more crowded international ski resorts. Situated near the holy town of Joshimath (around 13 km), Auli combines thrilling adventure with spiritual tranquility, drawing tourists throughout the year, especially during the winter season when it is covered in a thick blanket of snow.

### **History and Cultural Heritage**

Auli's history is relatively recent, having been developed as a ski resort in the late 1980s by the Uttar Pradesh Tourism Department (now Uttarakhand Tourism). However, the surrounding region is rich in ancient history and deeply rooted in Hindu mythology. The area around Joshimath, the gateway to Auli, holds immense religious significance. Joshimath is considered a sacred site and is associated with the revered Shankaracharya, who is believed to have attained enlightenment here. The ancient temple of Narasimha, one of the incarnations of Lord Vishnu, is a prominent landmark.
