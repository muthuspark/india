### **Introduction**

The Nartiang Monoliths, a cluster of standing stones nestled in the Jaintia Hills district of Meghalaya, India, is a testament to the rich cultural heritage and intriguing history of the region. Situated in Nartiang, the site offers a glimpse into the ancient practices and beliefs of the Jaintia people. Located approximately 60 km from the state capital, Shillong, and around 35 km from Jowai, the district headquarters, Nartiang is easily accessible and often visited as part of a broader Meghalaya itinerary. The monoliths, rising against the backdrop of the lush green hills, stand as silent witnesses to centuries of traditions and offer a unique and captivating experience.

### **History and Cultural Heritage**

The Nartiang Monoliths are steeped in Jaintia history and tradition. They are believed to be erected by the Jaintia kings and their subjects over a period of several centuries, starting from the 15th century. The monoliths commemorate the Jaintia rulers, warriors, and significant community members. The tallest of these stones, measuring around 25 feet, is said to have been erected by Mar Phlang, a general of the Jaintia Raja. These stones served as monuments, marking the accomplishments and memory of the deceased. They also held religious significance, likely connected to ancestor worship and communal rituals. The Jaintia people, with their matrilineal society and distinct traditions, have carefully preserved the site, making it a living monument to their heritage. The area surrounding the monoliths also hosts an ancient Durga Temple, showcasing a syncretic blend of Hindu and indigenous religious practices. The annual *Behdienkhlam* festival, though not held here, is closely related to the cultural beliefs surrounding the monoliths in the Jaintia Hills.
