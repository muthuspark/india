The Taj Mahal was commissioned in 1632 by the Mughal emperor Shah Jahan to house the tomb of his favorite wife, Mumtaz Mahal. The construction spanned approximately 22 years, involving over 20,000 artisans and craftsmen from across the Mughal Empire, Persia, Central Asia, and other regions. The architectural style is a harmonious blend of Persian, Islamic, and Indian elements.

Agra, before the construction of the Taj Mahal, was a significant cultural and political center, having served as the capital of the Mughal Empire for a considerable period. The city is steeped in history and boasts other important Mughal landmarks like Agra Fort and Itmad-ud-Daulah's Tomb. The cultural heritage of Agra is reflected in its traditional crafts, including marble inlay work (pietra dura), Zardozi embroidery, and leather goods. The city is also known for celebrating various religious festivals with vibrant enthusiasm, with a particularly strong influence of Islam and Hinduism. The city also bears witness to the glorious era of the Mughals, whose reign left an indelible mark on the architecture, art, and culture of the region.
