### **Introduction**

Dawki, a charming town nestled in the West Jaintia Hills district of Meghalaya, India, is renowned for its breathtaking natural beauty and the crystal-clear waters of the Umngot River. Located approximately 82 kilometers (51 miles) south of Shillong, the state's capital, Dawki sits close to the India-Bangladesh border. It's situated at an elevation of around 300 meters (984 feet) above sea level. The townâ€™s primary allure is the Umngot River, often called the cleanest river in India, where you can see the riverbed through the transparent water. This unique characteristic, combined with its serene surroundings and vibrant local culture, makes Dawki a must-visit destination. It is often a stopover point for those travelling to Cherrapunjee (Sohra) and other parts of Meghalaya.

### **History and Cultural Heritage**

The history of Dawki is closely intertwined with the Jaintia people, the indigenous community of this region. Historically, the area was part of the Jaintia Kingdom, a powerful kingdom that once ruled over a large territory encompassing parts of present-day Meghalaya and Bangladesh.  The region maintained a degree of autonomy, even during British colonial rule. The local culture is predominantly Khasia, with a strong emphasis on matrilineal traditions where property and lineage are traced through the mother. Dawki is a bustling border town with strong trading ties with Bangladesh, and this contributes to the unique cultural blend observed here. The town hosts local festivals, though they aren't as widely celebrated as in other parts of Meghalaya due to its border location. There are no major historical landmarks, but the overall environment is rich with the legacy of the Jaintia Kingdom and the unique border culture.

###  **Natural Beauty**

The play of sunlight on the river's clear surface creates an enchanting spectacle.



The surrounding forests are rich in biodiversity, supporting a wide range of flora and fauna. Viewpoints along the riverbank and on the surrounding hills offer spectacular panoramic views. Several smaller streams and waterfalls add to the scenic charm of the area.
