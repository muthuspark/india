### **Introduction**

The Mawphlang Sacred Forest, a verdant sanctuary nestled in the Khasi Hills of Meghalaya, India, is a living testament to the ancient Khasi people's deep reverence for nature. Located in the village of Mawphlang, approximately 25 kilometers south of Shillong, the state's capital, the forest is a unique ecosystem and cultural site, untouched by modern intervention and teeming with biodiversity. Its unique charm stems from the Khasi belief in the divine protection of the forest, which has fostered its preservation for centuries, offering visitors a captivating glimpse into a world where nature and spirituality are inextricably intertwined. The forest rests at an elevation of approximately 2000 meters. Nearby popular destinations include Shillong, Cherrapunji (Sohra), and the David Scott Trail, making it an accessible and enriching day trip or a stop along a broader Meghalaya itinerary.

### **History and Cultural Heritage**

The history of the Mawphlang Sacred Forest is deeply rooted in the traditional Khasi faith, known as *Niam Khasi*. For generations, the local Khasi community has held the forest sacred, believing it to be the abode of the local deity, *U Blei Mawphlang*. Access to the forest was and still is, regulated by the *Lyngdoh*, the hereditary High Priest who is the spiritual head of the village and the custodian of the forest.

The Khasi people have a matrilineal society, where lineage and inheritance are traced through the mother. This cultural aspect is reflected in their reverence for the earth, often seen as the mother of all life. The forest itself is considered a living entity, with a spirit to be respected. Cutting trees, removing anything from the forest, or even disturbing the natural order is strictly prohibited. The forest's protection is not enforced by any law but by the strong cultural taboos and beliefs of the community. This preservation is what makes the forest such an exceptional example of environmental stewardship. Historically, the forest has served as a place for traditional rituals, ceremonies, and conflict resolutions, solidifying its central role in the lives of the Mawphlang villagers.

### **Natural Beauty**

The Mawphlang Sacred Forest is a lush, evergreen forest, a relic of the ancient forests that once covered this region. Unlike other forests that might have been altered by human activity, the Sacred Forest has remained virtually untouched for hundreds of years.
