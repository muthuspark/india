### **Introduction**

The Garo Hills, a verdant mountain range located in the state of Meghalaya in Northeast India, are a captivating region known for their rich biodiversity, vibrant tribal culture, and breathtaking landscapes. Situated in the western part of Meghalaya, the Garo Hills offer a unique experience distinct from the more well-known Khasi and Jaintia Hills. The region's elevation varies considerably, with its highest peak, Nokrek, reaching over 1,400 meters (4,600 feet). The Garo Hills are relatively less crowded than other parts of Meghalaya, providing a more tranquil and immersive experience for travelers seeking an escape into nature and culture. The area is characterized by dense tropical forests, cascading waterfalls, and deep river valleys, making it an ideal destination for nature lovers and adventure enthusiasts.

### **History and Cultural Heritage**

The Garo Hills are home to the Garo people, one of the major indigenous tribes of Meghalaya. The Garos are believed to be of Tibeto-Burman origin and have a unique matrilineal society, where lineage and property are passed down through the mother. This matriarchal system is a defining characteristic of Garo culture. Historically, the Garo people fiercely resisted British rule, with the area only coming under colonial administration in the late 19th century. This history of resistance is reflected in their strong sense of identity and cultural pride.

The Garo culture is rich in traditions, folklore, and vibrant festivals. The Wangala festival, also known as the "Hundred Drums Festival," is the most important post-harvest festival, celebrated annually with great enthusiasm. This week-long celebration features traditional music, dance, and colorful attire.

The Nokrek Biosphere Reserve, located in the heart of the Garo Hills, is a site of significant cultural importance. It is considered the ancestral home of the Garos and is revered for its biodiversity and the presence of the *Memang Narang*, a sacred citrus fruit.
