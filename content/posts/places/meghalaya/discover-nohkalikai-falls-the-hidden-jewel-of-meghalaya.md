### **Introduction**

Nohkalikai Falls, a breathtaking cascade of water plummeting from a height of 340 meters (1,115 feet), is the tallest plunge waterfall in India. Nestled in the verdant hills of East Khasi Hills district of Meghalaya, India, the falls are a spectacular sight to behold, especially during the monsoon season. Located near the popular town of Cherrapunji (Sohra), renowned for receiving the highest rainfall in the world, Nohkalikai Falls offers a mesmerizing blend of natural beauty and compelling legend. Its sheer height, coupled with the surrounding lush greenery and the misty atmosphere, makes it a must-visit destination for nature lovers, adventure seekers, and anyone in search of awe-inspiring landscapes. The falls are a testament to the raw power and beauty of nature, a true jewel of the Meghalayan landscape.

### **History and Cultural Heritage**

The name "Nohkalikai" is derived from a tragic local legend.  "Noh" means "leap," "Ka" is a definitive article, and "Likai" refers to a local woman named Likai. The legend tells the story of a woman named Likai, who, after the death of her husband, remarried. Her new husband mistreated her daughter from her first marriage, ultimately leading to a horrific act of violence. Distraught and overcome with grief, Likai, upon discovering the truth, leaped over the falls to her death. The falls were then named in her memory, symbolizing the depth of her sorrow and the haunting beauty of the tragedy.

Culturally, the area around Nohkalikai Falls is rich in Khasi traditions. The Khasi people, who are the indigenous inhabitants of the region, have a unique matrilineal society where lineage and inheritance are traced through the mother.
