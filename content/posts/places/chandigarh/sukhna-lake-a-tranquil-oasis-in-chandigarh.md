### **History and Cultural Heritage**

Sukhna Lake was created in 1958 by Le Corbusier and P. L. Varma, the architects of Chandigarh, by damming the Sukhna Choe (a seasonal stream) to provide the city with a water source and to enhance its aesthetic appeal. The construction aimed not only to meet practical needs but also to shape the city’s character and provide recreational space for its residents. The lake's design was integrated into Chandigarh's urban planning, reflecting the modern architectural principles that guided the city's development. The cultural heritage of Sukhna Lake is intertwined with the ethos of Chandigarh – a city planned with a vision for balanced living, integrating nature and modernity. The lake’s presence has fostered a culture of health and leisure, with early morning walkers, joggers, and rowing enthusiasts becoming a familiar sight. The lake also hosts various cultural events and festivals, adding to its vibrant social atmosphere.
