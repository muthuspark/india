Spanning an area of approximately 625 square kilometers, it's one of India's oldest and largest national parks.

### **History and Cultural Heritage**

The name "Tadoba" originates from "Taru," the deity worshipped by the local tribal people, and "Aaba," which means father. The park has a history deeply rooted in the local tribal communities who have coexisted with the wildlife for centuries. Historically, the area was part of the Gondwana region, and remnants of Gondwana tribal settlements can still be found in the fringes of the park. The British colonial era saw limited intervention in the area, but the value of conserving its rich biodiversity was recognized in the early 20th century. Tadoba was declared a national park in 1955, aiming to protect its tigers and other wildlife.

The cultural fabric surrounding Tadoba is rich with Gond and Kolam tribal traditions. These communities have lived in harmony with the forest, relying on its resources for their livelihood. Visitors can often experience glimpses of tribal life through interactions with local guides or visits to nearby villages, providing a deeper understanding of the cultural heritage interwoven with the natural environment. The park and surrounding areas celebrate various local festivals reflecting their deep-rooted connection with the environment.
