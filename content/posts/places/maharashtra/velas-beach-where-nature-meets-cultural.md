### **Introduction**

Velas Beach, nestled on the Konkan coast of Maharashtra, India, is a serene coastal paradise, primarily known for its annual Turtle Festival. Located approximately 200 kilometers south of Mumbai, Velas belongs to the Mandangad Taluka of Ratnagiri district, offering a tranquil escape from the hustle and bustle of city life. It sits at an elevation of roughly 5 meters (16 feet) above sea level. While closer to Ratnagiri, the area shares some cultural similarities with Malvan, another popular Konkan destination known for its seafood and beaches. What truly distinguishes Velas is its remarkable commitment to the conservation of Olive Ridley sea turtles, making it a unique destination for nature lovers, conservationists, and those seeking a peaceful getaway. The Turtle Festival, the heart of Velas' charm, provides a rare opportunity to witness the marvel of nature as hundreds of baby turtles make their journey to the sea.

### **History and Cultural Heritage**

The history of Velas is intertwined with the broader historical narrative of the Konkan region, which has experienced periods of influence from various kingdoms and empires, including the Mauryas, Satavahanas, Chalukyas, and Marathas. The village itself likely has a history rooted in fishing and agriculture. While there are no major historical landmarks within Velas itself, the cultural heritage is strongly tied to the local traditions and practices of the Agri and Koli communities, who are predominant in the region. The annual Turtle Festival represents a significant shift towards environmental awareness and community-based conservation. This event, organized by the Sahyadri Nisarga Mitra (SNM), a non-profit organization, and supported by the local villagers, not only draws tourists but also reinforces the community's commitment to protecting the Olive Ridley turtles. Cultural influences from the nearby districts like Ratnagiri and Sindhudurg (Malvan) can be observed in the local cuisine and lifestyle.

The beach is relatively undeveloped, preserving its natural charm and offering a peaceful environment. The surrounding landscape is typical of the Konkan region, featuring lush greenery, coconut groves, and cashew plantations. The Western Ghats, though not towering, provide a scenic backdrop to the coastal area. The beach itself is the main attraction, offering scenic views, particularly during sunrise and sunset.
