### **Introduction**

Ross Island, now officially known as Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose Island, is a historically significant island located in the Andaman and Nicobar Islands, part of India. Situated in Port Blair, the capital city of the Andaman and Nicobar Islands, Ross Island sits just a short boat ride away from the main harbor. Its elevation is relatively low, typical of a tropical island. The island’s proximity to popular destinations like North Bay Island and Viper Island makes it a convenient stop for tourists. What makes Ross Island truly unique is its poignant blend of British colonial history, natural beauty, and a sense of eerie desolation, offering visitors a captivating experience.

### **History and Cultural Heritage**

Ross Island served as the administrative headquarters for the British during their rule over the Andaman and Nicobar Islands from 1858 to 1942. The island was the center of power, housing grand administrative buildings, churches, hospitals, and residences for the British officers and their families. It was here that the infamous Cellular Jail, used to imprison Indian freedom fighters, was governed and controlled. The island bears witness to significant historical events, including the arrival of the Japanese during World War II, who subsequently took over the island and used it as a base. The Japanese occupation led to the abandonment of the island, leaving behind a fascinating array of architectural ruins. After independence, the island was renamed in honor of Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose, a prominent Indian freedom fighter, who had visited the islands. <image placeholder="Ross Island Colonial Buildings">
