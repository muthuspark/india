### **Introduction**

Cellular Jail, also known as Kala Pani (Black Water), stands as a poignant testament to India's struggle for independence. Located in Port Blair, the capital of the Andaman and Nicobar Islands, this historical site offers a sobering glimpse into the harsh realities faced by Indian political prisoners during the British colonial rule. Situated on the eastern coast of South Andaman Island, the jail is easily accessible within Port Blair. Its proximity to other popular destinations within the Andaman and Nicobar archipelago makes it a central point for historical exploration. The unique feature of Cellular Jail lies in its architecture and the stories embedded within its walls, resonating with tales of courage, resilience, and sacrifice.

### **History and Cultural Heritage**

The construction of Cellular Jail began in 1896 and was completed in 1906. Designed to house Indian political prisoners, it was a solitary confinement facility. Its architecture, a complex structure with seven wings radiating from a central tower, aimed at isolating inmates and preventing communication. The jail was infamous for its brutal treatment of prisoners, including enforced manual labor, such as oil mills and coir making. Prominent Indian freedom fighters, including Veer Savarkar, Batukeshwar Dutt, and Yogendra Shukla, were imprisoned here. The jail served as a symbol of British oppression and a crucible of the Indian independence movement. Following India's independence in 1947, Cellular Jail was declared a national memorial. A museum and light and sound show are now operational, narrating the history of the jail and the stories of the inmates. The jail's legacy continues to be a source of inspiration and reflection on the sacrifices made for India's freedom.
