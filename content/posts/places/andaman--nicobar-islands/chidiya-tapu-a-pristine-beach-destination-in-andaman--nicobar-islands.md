Located approximately 28 kilometers from Port Blair, the capital city, it's a place renowned for its stunning sunsets, diverse birdlife, and lush tropical landscapes.

### **History and Cultural Heritage**

The history of Chidiya Tapu, like the wider Andaman and Nicobar Islands, is intertwined with its geographical isolation and subsequent interactions with various groups. Historically, the islands were inhabited by indigenous Andamanese tribes for thousands of years, with limited contact with the outside world. During the colonial era, the British established a penal colony in Port Blair, known as the Cellular Jail, and Chidiya Tapu, though not the focus of intense colonial activity, was part of the larger administrative region. While Chidiya Tapu itself doesn’t feature specific historical landmarks that rival the Cellular Jail, the area’s significance lies more in its natural heritage. The cultural heritage of Chidiya Tapu is primarily reflected in its local fishing communities and their simple way of life, which continues to contribute to the charm of this area. There are no major historical landmarks, temples, or significant cultural events that dominate the scene; instead, the area fosters a peaceful atmosphere.

The area features rugged coastlines, pristine beaches, and a variety of viewpoints offering spectacular panoramas. The most renowned viewpoint is the Chidiya Tapu Biological Park, which provides unparalleled views of the sunset over the sea – a truly mesmerizing spectacle that draws crowds daily.  The entire region around Chidiya Tapu is rich with natural attractions; the dense forests and the shoreline where the forest meets the sea providing a unique and scenic environment.
