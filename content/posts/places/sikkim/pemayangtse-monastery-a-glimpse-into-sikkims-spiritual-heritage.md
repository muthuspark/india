### **Introduction**

Pelling, a serene town nestled in the West Sikkim district of the Indian state of Sikkim, offers breathtaking views of the snow-capped Kanchenjunga, the world's third-highest peak. Situated at an altitude of approximately 2,150 meters (7,200 feet), Pelling is a popular tourist destination, serving as a gateway to many other attractions in West Sikkim. Its strategic location, relatively close to the capital Gangtok (approximately 115 km), and proximity to the ancient Pemayangtse Monastery make it a compelling place to experience the natural beauty and cultural richness of the region. Pelling is unique for its panoramic vistas, a blend of ancient monasteries, historical ruins, and the accessibility it offers to some of Sikkim's most important cultural and natural sites.

### **History and Cultural Heritage**

The history of Pelling and its surrounding areas is intricately linked to the evolution of Buddhism in Sikkim. The region was originally inhabited by the Lepcha people, the indigenous inhabitants of Sikkim. Later, the Bhutias migrated from Tibet, bringing with them their Buddhist faith and establishing several monasteries.

The Pemayangtse Monastery, the second oldest in Sikkim, is one of the most historically significant sites in the area. Founded in 1705, it played a crucial role in the spiritual and political landscape of Sikkim. The monastery houses a magnificent collection of religious artifacts, including a stunning seven-tiered model of Guru Rinpoche (Padmasambhava), crafted from wood. The monastery also maintained a tradition of selecting only the purest monks from noble Bhutia families. The ruins of the Rabdentse Palace, the second capital of the Kingdom of Sikkim, are a testament to the area's historical importance. This palace was destroyed by the invading Gurkha army in the late 18th century and offers a glimpse into the region's royal past.

The cultural heritage is also reflected in local festivals. Losar, the Tibetan New Year, and Saga Dawa, which celebrates the birth and enlightenment of Buddha, are celebrated with great zeal. These festivals often involve traditional dances, music, and vibrant displays of local culture.
