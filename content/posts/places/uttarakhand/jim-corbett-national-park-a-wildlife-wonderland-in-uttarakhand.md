### **History and Cultural Heritage**

The history of Jim Corbett National Park is deeply intertwined with its namesake, Edward James Corbett, a legendary hunter turned conservationist. Established in 1936 as Hailey National Park, it was renamed Jim Corbett National Park in 1957 in his honor. Corbett played a crucial role in protecting the area from deforestation and preserving its wildlife. The park's creation was a pivotal moment in the history of wildlife conservation in India. The park’s culture is predominantly influenced by the indigenous communities that have lived in and around the region for centuries. These communities have traditionally coexisted with the wildlife, relying on the forest for sustenance and resources. While the park's focus is conservation, you can still find remnants of this cultural interaction in the local villages and their customs. The park area is dotted with old buildings from the colonial era, providing glimpses into its historical past.
