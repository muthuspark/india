### **Introduction**

Keibul Lamjao National Park, nestled in the Moirang district of Manipur, India, is a place of unparalleled beauty and ecological significance. Located approximately 50 km south of Imphal, the capital city of Manipur, this unique park is situated on the southeastern shore of Loktak Lake, the largest freshwater lake in Northeast India. The park's elevation is relatively low, ranging from approximately 768 to 817 meters above sea level. Keibul Lamjao is renowned worldwide as the only floating national park in the world, a testament to its extraordinary ecosystem. This floating landscape, comprised of decomposed plants, soil, and organic matter called "phumdi," supports a unique biodiversity and offers an experience unlike any other. The park's heart is the preservation of the critically endangered Manipur brow-antlered deer (Sangai), a species found nowhere else in the world.


### **History and Cultural Heritage**

The history of Keibul Lamjao National Park is intertwined with the ecological and cultural history of the Loktak Lake region and the indigenous Meitei people. The area has been a vital part of the local communities for centuries, with the lake providing a source of livelihood, transportation, and cultural significance. The Sangai deer, the park's emblem, is deeply embedded in the folklore and cultural identity of Manipur, often referred to as the "Jewel of Manipur." The area was officially declared a national park in 1977, aiming to protect the Sangai and its fragile habitat.  The formation of phumdi, the unique floating biomass, has been a natural process shaped by the lake's ecology and the seasonal cycles of the environment.  The park's existence is a continuous dialogue between conservation efforts and the socio-economic requirements of the surrounding communities who rely on the lake for resources. The preservation efforts have been bolstered by community involvement and various government programs aimed at sustainable development.


### **Natural Beauty**

Keibul Lamjao National Park is a mesmerizing tapestry woven by the floating phumdi, the vast expanse of Loktak Lake, and the surrounding hills. The landscape appears dreamlike, with patches of dense vegetation and open water interspersed with floating islands.  The park's primary feature is the phumdi, which supports the unique vegetation that serves as the deer's primary food source. These floating masses shift and reshape with the seasonal changes and water levels of the lake. The lake itself offers stunning vistas, especially during sunrise and sunset, when the sky reflects in the calm water. The surrounding hills, though not within the park's immediate boundaries, add to the scenic panorama, providing a backdrop of lush greenery. From the watchtowers and observation points within the park, visitors can capture breathtaking panoramic views of the phumdi, the lake, and the deer roaming freely.

### **Flora and Fauna**

Keibul Lamjao National Park boasts a unique and diverse ecosystem. The park's vegetation is mainly composed of floating phumdi, consisting of a mix of organic matter, soil, and decomposed plant material. This creates a floating habitat that supports various plant species, including grasses and shrubs. The Sangai deer is the park's flagship species and is critically endangered. Other wildlife species include several species of birds, reptiles, and fish. The park's aquatic environment also supports various aquatic plants and plankton, which are essential for the lake's overall ecology. The phumdi provides a unique habitat for a variety of insects and small animals, forming a complex food web.


### **Best Time to Visit**

The best time to visit Keibul Lamjao National Park is during the winter months, from November to March. During this period, the weather is generally pleasant with clear skies, making it ideal for wildlife viewing and exploration. The water levels in Loktak Lake are relatively stable, and the chances of spotting the Sangai deer and other wildlife are higher. It is also important to be aware of the monsoon season, which typically begins around May and lasts through September, bringing heavy rainfall that can make the park less accessible. Visiting during the tourist season also coincides with cultural festivals in Manipur, providing an opportunity to experience local traditions.


### **How to Reach**

You can also utilize public transport like buses and shared jeeps, though this might take longer. The nearest railway station is Dimapur, in Nagaland, which is approximately 200 kilometers away from Imphal, and would necessitate another leg of travel to reach the park. Road connectivity is generally good, but be aware of traffic and occasional road conditions.
