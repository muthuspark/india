### **Introduction**

Dwarka, a sacred city steeped in legend and history, is a revered destination nestled on the western coast of Gujarat, India. Though geographically located in the Devbhoomi Dwarka district, its historical and spiritual significance is inextricably linked to the nearby city of Porbandar, the birthplace of Mahatma Gandhi.  It sits near the confluence of the Gomti River with the Arabian Sea. Dwarka holds immense importance in Hinduism, believed to be the ancient kingdom of Lord Krishna. Its location is approximately 137 kilometers from Porbandar and around 375 kilometers from Ahmedabad. This coastal city offers a unique blend of spirituality, ancient architecture, vibrant culture, and stunning natural beauty, making it a compelling destination for both pilgrims and tourists.  It stands at a low elevation along the coastline.  The area is known for its calm waters, ancient temples, and opportunities to connect with Indian history.

### **History and Cultural Heritage**

Dwarka's history is interwoven with the life of Lord Krishna, a pivotal figure in Hinduism. According to mythology, Krishna established his kingdom here after leaving Mathura. The city is believed to have been submerged and rebuilt multiple times over thousands of years. Archaeological excavations have provided evidence of settlements dating back to the Bronze Age. The city is mentioned in the Mahabharata and other ancient scriptures, solidifying its significance in Hindu cosmology.



The cultural heritage of Dwarka is deeply rooted in devotion to Lord Krishna. The Dwarkadhish Temple, dedicated to Krishna, is the heart of the city and a major pilgrimage site.  The temple's elaborate architecture, intricate carvings, and the daily rituals create a deeply spiritual atmosphere.  Festivals such as Janmashtami (Lord Krishna's birthday) are celebrated with great fervor, attracting thousands of devotees.  The city is a center for Vaishnavism, the devotional tradition focused on Lord Vishnu and his incarnations.  Apart from the Dwarkadhish Temple, other significant sites include Rukmini Devi Temple, dedicated to Krishna's consort, and several ghats (steps leading to the water) along the Gomti River.
