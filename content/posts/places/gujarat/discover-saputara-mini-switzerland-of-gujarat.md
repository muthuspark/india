Located in the Dang district and positioned specifically within the *Vailanki* region of Gujarat, Saputara offers a refreshing escape from the scorching heat of the plains. At an elevation of approximately 1,000 meters (3,300 feet) above sea level, it provides cool and pleasant weather throughout most of the year.

Saputara is about 250 km from Surat and 300 km from Mumbai, making it an accessible weekend getaway. Its unique blend of natural beauty and cultural richness makes Saputara a truly special place to visit.

### **History and Cultural Heritage**

The history of Saputara is interwoven with the tribal communities that have long inhabited the Dang district. The region has a rich tribal heritage, primarily influenced by the Bhil and other indigenous groups. The name "Saputara" itself, meaning "abode of serpents" in the local dialect, is derived from the presence of a serpent deity revered by the tribal communities. The area was historically a part of the Dangs district, which remained relatively isolated until the 20th century. The impact of colonial rule was less pronounced here compared to other parts of Gujarat. Saputara's development as a tourist destination gained momentum in the latter half of the 20th century, with efforts to promote its natural beauty and tribal culture.

The cultural landscape of Saputara is dominated by the traditions, customs, and rituals of the local tribal communities. The area hosts several colorful festivals and fairs, reflecting their unique art forms, music, and dance. The "Dang Darbar," held annually, is a prominent cultural event where tribal chiefs and communities gather to showcase their heritage. Religious practices are deeply rooted in nature worship and the veneration of local deities. Key historical landmarks are fewer in number but the very landscape tells a story of isolation and a preserved way of life.
