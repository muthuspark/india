### **History and Cultural Heritage**

The Lepakshi Temple, also known as Veerabhadra Temple, was built in the 16th century during the reign of the Vijayanagara Empire by Virupanna Nayaka, the treasurer of the royal court. Legend has it that Virupanna Nayaka started construction on the temple after receiving funds from the king, but was later accused of misappropriation. To prove his innocence, he gouged out his own eyes, leaving behind two large bloodstains which are still visible on a rock near the temple. The temple is dedicated to Veerabhadra, a fierce form of Lord Shiva.

The cultural significance of Lepakshi is immense. It is a living embodiment of the Vijayanagara artistic prowess, showcasing exquisite carvings, sculptures, and murals that narrate tales from the Ramayana, Mahabharata, and the Puranas. The temple's architecture is characterized by its granite construction, intricate friezes, and detailed sculptures. The iconic "Hanging Pillar," which touches the ground only at one point, and the colossal monolithic Nandi bull statue are prominent examples of the engineering and artistic excellence of the time. Festivals like Maha Shivaratri are celebrated with great fervor, attracting devotees and tourists from all over the region. <img src="placeholder_lepakshi_history.jpg" alt="Lepakshi Temple History">
