The history of Simhachalam Temple is deeply rooted in Hindu mythology and dates back to ancient times.  It is believed that the temple existed even during the Vedic period.  The presiding deity, Lord Vishnu, is worshipped in the form of Varaha Narasimha, a unique avatar that combines the boar (Varaha) and lion (Narasimha) incarnations.

The temple has undergone numerous renovations and expansions over centuries.
