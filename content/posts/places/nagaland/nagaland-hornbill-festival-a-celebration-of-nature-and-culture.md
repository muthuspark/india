### **Introduction**

The Nagaland Hornbill Festival, hosted annually in Kohima, Nagaland, is a vibrant celebration of the Naga heritage, a kaleidoscope of culture, dance, music, and tradition. This iconic festival, held at the Naga Heritage Village (Kisama), approximately 10 km from the state capital, Kohima, is a significant event, offering a window into the fascinating lives and customs of the Naga people. Kohima sits at an elevation of around 1,444 meters (4,737 feet), nestled in the mountainous terrain of Nagaland, and is easily accessible from Dimapur, the state's only airport, roughly 74 km away. The Hornbill Festival is unique because it brings together the rich tapestry of sixteen Naga tribes, allowing visitors to witness their distinct dances, songs, crafts, and rituals, all in one place. It's a festival of unity, celebrating the diversity that makes Nagaland so special.

### **History and Cultural Heritage**

The history of Kohima and the Naga people is deeply intertwined. The region has a rich and complex past, with various tribes often maintaining their own distinct territories and traditions. During the British colonial era, the region was a site of resistance and conflict, particularly during World War II, when Kohima was the scene of a crucial battle that ultimately stopped the Japanese advance into India. The Kohima War Cemetery stands as a poignant reminder of this historical event. The Naga people are known for their warrior traditions, intricate craftsmanship, and vibrant oral traditions, which are often passed down through generations. The Hornbill Festival, initiated by the Government of Nagaland, was started in 2000 to promote inter-tribal interaction and showcase the rich cultural heritage of the Naga people. The name "Hornbill" is in reference to the hornbill bird, which is prominently featured in Naga folklore and is revered by several tribes for its grace, courage, and vigilance.
