### **Introduction**

Surajkund Mela, an annual crafts fair held in Surajkund, Haryana, is a vibrant celebration of Indian culture, handicrafts, and traditions. Located in the Faridabad district of Haryana, it is a short distance from Delhi, making it easily accessible for both domestic and international tourists.  The mela (fair) is unique in its focus on showcasing the rich tapestry of Indian arts, crafts, and textiles, attracting artisans and craftspeople from all over India and even other countries. It's a dynamic and colorful experience offering a glimpse into the diverse heritage of India.

### **History and Cultural Heritage**

The Surajkund Mela has been held annually since 1987. Its primary objective is to provide a platform for artisans from various states of India to showcase their skills and sell their products, preserving and promoting the crafts that are often threatened by modern mass production. The fair also aims to facilitate cultural exchange by inviting a "Theme State" each year, which is given the opportunity to present its unique culture, arts, and handicrafts. Additionally, a "Partner Nation" is invited to participate, adding an international flavor to the event. The mela site itself is adjacent to the ancient Surajkund reservoir, a historical site with its own cultural significance dating back to the 10th century, adding another layer of history to the experience.

### **Natural Beauty**

The Surajkund area is nestled in the Aravalli hills, providing a picturesque backdrop to the fair.  The hills offer a rugged landscape with a semi-arid climate. While the immediate fairground is primarily a man-made expanse, the surrounding hills offer opportunities for scenic drives and glimpses of natural beauty. The nearby Asola-Bhatti Wildlife Sanctuary provides a haven for various bird species, making it an attractive option for nature enthusiasts and birdwatchers who wish to extend their visit beyond the mela.

### **Must-Visit Attractions**

The main attraction is undoubtedly the **Surajkund Mela** itself.  Visitors can immerse themselves in the vibrant atmosphere, exploring numerous stalls that showcase handcrafted items from across India. These include textiles, pottery, woodcraft, metalwork, jewellery, and traditional clothing. Beyond the Mela, the **Surajkund reservoir**, a historical monument believed to have been built by King Suraj Pal of the Tomar dynasty in the 10th century, is a must-visit. The semi-circular amphitheater-shaped reservoir is a testament to ancient engineering and architectural skill. The area near the reservoir often hosts cultural performances and events during the Mela.

### **Adventure Activities**

While the primary focus of Surajkund is on culture and crafts, the proximity to the Aravalli hills provides limited opportunities for adventure. Hiking and nature walks in the surrounding hills are possible for those looking for outdoor activities. While more extensive adventure activities like trekking, rock climbing, and rappelling are not typically organized at the mela itself, the area is not far from locations offering these services, allowing visitors to combine their cultural experience with adventure if desired.

### **Local Markets and Handicrafts**

The entire Surajkund Mela is essentially a massive market dedicated to handicrafts. Visitors can find a vast array of products, from intricately designed textiles, including handloom sarees and embroidered fabrics, to exquisite pottery and terracotta items.  Wooden toys, furniture, and decorative items, along with metalwork, including brass and copper items, are also prominently displayed. The "Theme State" and "Partner Nation" pavilions offer a focused opportunity to explore the crafts and textiles unique to those regions or countries.

### **Food and Cuisine**

The Surajkund Mela is a haven for food lovers, offering a wide variety of regional Indian cuisines. Food stalls and restaurants serve traditional dishes from various states of India, allowing visitors to embark on a culinary journey. From Rajasthani dal baati churma and Bihari litti chokha to Punjabi parathas and South Indian idli-dosa, there's something for every palate.  Street food like chaat, golgappe, and jalebis add to the festive ambiance. The food stalls are a major draw, creating a lively and flavorful atmosphere.

### **Flora and Fauna**

The area around Surajkund, while not boasting extensive flora and fauna directly within the mela grounds, is close to the Asola-Bhatti Wildlife Sanctuary. This sanctuary is known for its diverse birdlife and provides a green lung in the Delhi-NCR region.

Other parts of the Aravalli hills support diverse vegetation, offering opportunities for nature walks and exploration.
