Situated at an average elevation ranging from 100 to 400 meters above sea level, Manas offers a stunning tapestry of landscapes, from grassy savannas and dense tropical forests to meandering rivers and rolling hills.

### **History and Cultural Heritage**

The history of Manas National Park is intertwined with both royal and indigenous influences. The area was initially a reserved forest. The name “Manas” is derived from the Manas River, which flows through the park, and the river itself is named after the serpent god, Manasa. The park's boundaries and conservation efforts were significantly developed after independence, playing a pivotal role in the area's preservation.

Culturally, the region is home to several indigenous communities, including the Bodo, Rabha, and Assamese people. Their culture is rich in traditions, festivals, and handicrafts.  The Bodo people, in particular, have a strong connection to the land and the preservation of its natural resources.  The park and surrounding areas showcase vibrant cultures, with colorful festivals often celebrated, blending the love for nature and rich cultural heritage.
