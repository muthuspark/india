### **Introduction**

Majuli Island, a mesmerizing river island nestled in the heart of the Brahmaputra River in Assam, India, is a place unlike any other. Located in the district of Majuli, it holds the distinction of being the world's largest river island, a testament to the dynamic power of nature. Majuli is characterized by its constantly shifting landscapes, rich cultural heritage deeply rooted in Vaishnavism, and a vibrant ecosystem. With an average elevation barely above the river's surface, the island is a living, breathing entity, shaped by the monsoons and the mighty Brahmaputra. Nearby popular destinations include Jorhat, the closest city, which serves as the gateway to Majuli. Its unique blend of natural beauty and cultural significance makes Majuli a truly unforgettable destination.

### **History and Cultural Heritage**

The history of Majuli is interwoven with the Brahmaputra and the growth of Vaishnavism. The island has been inhabited for centuries, with its unique cultural identity largely shaped by the Vaishnavite monasteries, known as Satras, established by the revered saint and social reformer Srimanta Sankardeva in the 15th century. These Satras are not just religious institutions; they are also cultural centers, preserving ancient art forms, classical dance (Sattriya Nritya), music, and theatre. The island was once much larger but has gradually shrunk due to erosion caused by the Brahmaputra River, a constant reminder of nature's powerful forces. The Mishing tribe, along with other indigenous communities, have also contributed greatly to the cultural fabric of Majuli.
