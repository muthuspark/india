### **History and Cultural Heritage**

Sivasagar’s history is inextricably linked to the Ahom dynasty, who ruled Assam for nearly six centuries (1228-1826). The Ahoms, of Tai origin, established their capital in Sivasagar in the late 17th century. During their reign, Sivasagar flourished as a center of power, art, and culture. The Ahom rulers were great patrons of architecture, constructing numerous monuments, tanks (ponds), and temples that still stand as testaments to their craftsmanship and vision.

The cultural landscape of Sivasagar is equally vibrant. The town is dotted with temples and religious sites, reflecting the deep-rooted faith of the people. The *Bohag Bihu* festival, the Assamese New Year, is celebrated with great enthusiasm, marked by traditional dances like *Bihu* and vibrant cultural performances. Other important festivals include *Magh Bihu* and *Kaati Bihu*, each celebrated with unique rituals and customs.

Historical landmarks are central to Sivasagar’s identity. The most iconic structure is the *Rang Ghar*, a two-storied pavilion considered to be one of the oldest amphitheaters in Asia.
