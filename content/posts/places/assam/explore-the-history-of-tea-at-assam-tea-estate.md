### **Introduction**

Dibrugarh, often referred to as the "Tea City of India," is a vibrant city located in the Dibrugarh district of Assam, India. Nestled in the northeastern part of the country, it sits on the banks of the Brahmaputra River, a lifeline for the region. The city is at an elevation of approximately 110 meters (360 feet) above sea level.

### **History and Cultural Heritage**

The history of Dibrugarh is deeply intertwined with the Ahom dynasty, who ruled Assam for nearly 600 years. The city's name, "Dibru" is derived from the Dibru River. While the area was inhabited for centuries, its rise to prominence accelerated during the British colonial period due to the discovery of tea plantations. The British East India Company established numerous tea estates, transforming Dibrugarh into a major commercial hub. This legacy is visible in the architecture and lifestyle of the city.

Culturally, Dibrugarh is a melting pot, reflecting the diversity of Assam. The local Assamese culture is predominant, with influences from various indigenous communities, including the Mishing, Deori, and Sonowal Kachari tribes. The city celebrates vibrant festivals like Bihu, the Assamese New Year, marked by traditional music, dance, and feasting. Other significant celebrations include Durga Puja and Diwali. The legacy of the Ahom dynasty can be observed in the ruins of forts and the architecture of some older buildings. Religious sites, including temples and mosques, further enrich the cultural tapestry of Dibrugarh.
