### **Introduction**

Orang National Park, a verdant sanctuary nestled in the heart of Assam, India, is a biodiversity hotspot that captivates with its rich wildlife and stunning landscapes. Situated in the Sonitpur district, the park lies on the north bank of the Brahmaputra River, a short distance from the city of Tezpur. It boasts an elevation ranging from 50 to 80 meters above sea level. Orang National Park stands out for its relatively small size yet remarkable density of wildlife, offering visitors a microcosm of Assam's natural heritage and a chance to witness the majestic Indian one-horned rhinoceros in its natural habitat. Its proximity to Kaziranga National Park adds to its appeal, often considered a "mini Kaziranga" due to its similar ecological characteristics.

### **History and Cultural Heritage**

The history of Orang National Park is intrinsically linked to the cultural and historical tapestry of Assam. While specific historical records detailing the park's direct evolution are limited, the area's past reflects Assam's general socio-cultural influences. Before its gazettement as a sanctuary, the land had seen a long history of human habitation and use, including agricultural practices and fishing along the Brahmaputra. The indigenous communities, particularly the Bodo and Mising tribes, have long had a close relationship with the land, relying on its resources for sustenance. This cultural heritage has continued even as the park's conservation efforts have intensified. In 1985, it was declared a wildlife sanctuary, and subsequently, in 1999, it was upgraded to a National Park, reflecting the growing recognition of its ecological significance. Although Orang National Park has a limited number of physical historical landmarks within its boundaries, its cultural significance rests on its role in preserving Assam's wildlife and ecosystem, thus safeguarding the cultural heritage tied to the natural environment.

###  **Natural Beauty**

The landscape of Orang National Park is predominantly characterized by lush grasslands, fertile floodplains, and patches of evergreen forests. The Brahmaputra River, flowing along its southern border, contributes immensely to the park's ecological richness, providing water and creating a diverse ecosystem. The presence of the river makes the park an alluvial plain that experiences flooding during monsoon seasons. The park's landscape is predominantly flat, making it accessible for safari drives. The grasslands are punctuated by small hills and water bodies, creating a mosaic of habitats ideal for diverse wildlife. There are not any specific viewpoints within the park; the best views are from the jeep safaris, allowing visitors to immerse themselves in the natural beauty surrounding them. The combination of grasslands, riverine forests, and water bodies provide a habitat to a myriad of bird species and other animals.

### **Must-Visit Attractions**

Orang National Park is itself the main attraction, serving as a haven for wildlife enthusiasts and nature lovers. Its compact size offers a concentrated wildlife viewing experience, allowing visitors to witness the iconic Indian one-horned rhinoceros in its natural habitat.  Beyond rhinos, the park also supports elephants, tigers (though sightings are rare), various species of deer, and an array of birdlife. Jeep safaris are the primary mode of exploring the park and provide the best opportunities for wildlife sightings. The proximity to the Brahmaputra River also provides a scenic backdrop for visitors. The park offers a more intimate wildlife experience compared to the more famous Kaziranga, making it ideal for those seeking a less crowded environment. While the park does not boast historical temples or monuments inside the park, the experience lies in the immersive journey within the natural world.

However, bird-watching is another popular activity, with numerous migratory and resident species. The park is relatively unexplored for other adventure activities such as trekking and water sports due to the protected status and conservation requirements.
