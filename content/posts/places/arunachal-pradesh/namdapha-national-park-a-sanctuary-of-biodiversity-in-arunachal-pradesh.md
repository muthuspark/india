### **Introduction**

Namdapha National Park, nestled in the district of Tawang Chung, Arunachal Pradesh, stands as a biodiversity hotspot and a pristine wilderness. Located in the eastern Himalayas, this park is not only a haven for a vast array of flora and fauna but also offers a unique window into the rich cultural heritage of the region. At an elevation ranging from approximately 200 to 4500 meters above sea level, the park's varied altitudes contribute to its exceptional biodiversity. It is relatively remote, making it a true escape for nature lovers and adventure seekers.

The park is distinguished by its dense evergreen forests, unique wildlife, and the untouched beauty of the Eastern Himalayas.
