### **Introduction**

Pakhui Wildlife Sanctuary, a hidden gem nestled in the verdant embrace of Arunachal Pradesh, India, offers a captivating blend of biodiversity and untamed beauty. This sanctuary is a haven for wildlife enthusiasts and nature lovers alike. Perched at varying elevations, the sanctuary's rugged terrain and dense forests are a testament to the Eastern Himalayas’ unique ecosystem. While Ziro is famous for its beautiful valley and Apatani tribe culture, the Pakhui Wildlife Sanctuary offers an entirely different and equally enriching experience. The sanctuary’s proximity to other popular destinations in Arunachal Pradesh makes it an accessible destination for a diverse range of travellers. Pakhui is unique for its dense tiger population, diverse avian life, and relatively undisturbed natural environment.

### **History and Cultural Heritage**

The history of Pakhui Wildlife Sanctuary is interwoven with the traditions of the indigenous communities of the area, primarily the Nyishi tribe. Historically, these forests were integral to their way of life, providing sustenance and resources. The colonial influence in the region was limited, but the area's significance as a biodiversity hotspot gradually came to light. The sanctuary itself was formally established in 1977 and later upgraded to a tiger reserve in 2002.

The local culture, though not directly within the boundaries of the sanctuary itself, significantly influences the surrounding regions. The Nyishi people's traditions, colourful festivals, and spiritual beliefs resonate throughout the area. Festivals like Mopin (celebrated by the Galo tribe, not specifically in the sanctuary’s immediate vicinity) are vibrant displays of community bonding and offer a glimpse into the rich cultural tapestry of Arunachal Pradesh. The traditional villages that border the sanctuary often house important community centres and religious structures, reflecting the deep spiritual connection the people have with the natural world.
