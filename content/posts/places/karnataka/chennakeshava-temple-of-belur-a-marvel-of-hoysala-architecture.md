### **History and Cultural Heritage**

The history of Belur and Halebidu is inextricably linked to the Hoysala dynasty, who ruled South India from the 11th to the 14th centuries. Belur, originally known as Velapur, was the first capital of the Hoysalas and remained an important religious center. Halebidu, meaning "old city," became the capital in the 12th century after the Hoysalas shifted their administrative center. The Hoysalas were great patrons of art and architecture, and under their rule, these towns flourished. The temples at Belur and Halebidu were constructed over several decades, reflecting a blend of architectural styles. However, the region faced attacks from invaders, most notably the Delhi Sultanate in the 14th century, resulting in significant damage to the temples. Nevertheless, the enduring beauty of the structures highlights the Hoysalas' commitment to artistic excellence.

Culturally, Belur and Halebidu are deeply rooted in Hinduism. The temples are dedicated to various deities, primarily Vishnu and Shiva. The annual car festivals (Rathotsava) are major events attracting large crowds of devotees.

Local traditions and rituals are still practiced, reflecting the region's vibrant cultural heritage.
