### **Introduction**

Utsav Rock Garden, a unique and captivating sculpture park, is nestled in the heart of Bangalore, Karnataka, India. While Bangalore is known for its tech industry and vibrant city life, Utsav Rock Garden offers a refreshing contrast, showcasing artistry and a deep connection to nature. This unusual attraction, located a convenient distance from the bustling city center, offers a fascinating blend of art, sculpture, and a celebration of rural life. Although Bangalore doesn't have a specific elevation, it is a city on a plateau, giving it a pleasant climate. It's easily accessible from popular destinations like the Bangalore Palace and Cubbon Park. What makes Utsav Rock Garden truly unique is its innovative use of rock sculptures to depict rural life, folk art, and cultural scenes, providing a visual narrative that engages and delights visitors of all ages.

### **History and Cultural Heritage**

The Utsav Rock Garden is a relatively recent creation, founded and conceptualized by S.S. Prithvi, a self-taught artist. It is not associated with any historical figures or colonial influences in the traditional sense. Instead, its cultural significance lies in its celebration and preservation of rural Karnataka's heritage and artistic traditions. The garden aims to capture the essence of village life, depicting various aspects of rural activities, festivals, and daily routines through its sculptures.

The garden showcases the folk art and traditions that are vital components of Karnataka's cultural landscape. The sculptures depict scenes of village fairs, agricultural practices, the life of farmers, local art forms, and traditional craftsmanship. It essentially preserves and visualizes the cultural memory of a region that's rapidly transforming. The absence of specific historical landmarks is made up for by the garden's presentation of everyday historical scenes, telling the story of the local people's lives through its art.

### **Natural Beauty**

While Utsav Rock Garden itself is a man-made marvel, the beauty of the surrounding landscape complements its charm.

The surrounding environment of Bangalore, with its parks, green spaces, and moderate climate, creates a pleasant atmosphere for visitors.
