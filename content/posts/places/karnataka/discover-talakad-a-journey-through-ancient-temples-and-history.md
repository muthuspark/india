### **Introduction**

Talakad, a historically significant town nestled on the banks of the Kaveri River in the Chamarajanagar district of Karnataka, India, is a place steeped in legend and shrouded in mystery. Located approximately 45 kilometers from Mysore and about 133 kilometers from Bangalore, Talakad lies at an elevation of approximately 530 meters (1,740 feet) above sea level. Its proximity to the popular destinations of Mysore and Bandipur National Park makes it an easily accessible day trip or a comfortable stopover for those exploring the region. Talakad is unique for its history of being cursed, its buried temples, and its stunning natural beauty, all intertwined to offer a truly captivating and unforgettable experience.

### **History and Cultural Heritage**

The history of Talakad is a fascinating tapestry woven with threads of royal dynasties, religious fervor, and a lingering curse. The town served as a significant center for various ruling empires, including the Gangas, Cholas, Hoysalas, and Wodeyars. The Gangas, who ruled from the 4th to the 11th centuries, built numerous temples and significantly developed the town. The Cholas, from the 11th century onwards, expanded Talakad's influence, but their reign ended in a dramatic turn of events.

According to legend, the town was cursed by Alamelamma, the wife of the Vijayanagar chieftain, who fled to Talakad while pursued by the Wodeyar king of Mysore. As she drowned herself in the Kaveri River, she uttered a curse: "Talakad Maraali, Malangi Maduva, Mysuru arasige makkilla!" ("May Talakad be buried in sand, May Malangi become a whirlpool, and may the Mysore kings bear no children!"). This curse is believed to be responsible for the shifting sands that periodically bury the ancient temples of Talakad, and the whirlpool-like effect in the Kaveri at Malangi, a nearby location. The Wodeyars, despite attempts to counteract the curse, found the lineage of the royal family often struggling with the birth of an heir.

The cultural heritage of Talakad is primarily religious, with temples dedicated to various Hindu deities dominating the landscape. Key historical landmarks include the Vaidyanatheshwara temple, which is the most prominent temple in the Panchalinga group, and the Kirti Narayana Temple, known for its beautiful architecture. The submerged temples are periodically excavated, revealing stunning architecture and intricate carvings. These temples are major attractions for pilgrims and history enthusiasts alike.

Talakad is blessed with a serene and captivating natural environment. The Kaveri River, which flows along its shores, is the lifeblood of the region, providing stunning water vistas and creating a fertile environment. The landscape around Talakad is relatively flat, offering open spaces and views of the river.

The most prominent natural feature of Talakad is the shifting sand, which dramatically changes the appearance of the landscape, sometimes burying the temples entirely and creating a unique and unusual environment. The riverbanks offer scenic spots where visitors can enjoy the beauty of the Kaveri, watch the sunset, and capture stunning photographs. The surrounding areas, though not dense forest, are dotted with greenery and farmland, enhancing the tranquility of the location.
