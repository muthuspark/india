### **Introduction**

Chikmagalur, a verdant hill station nestled in the state of Karnataka, India, is often referred to as the "Coffee Land of Karnataka." Situated in the foothills of the Mullayanagiri range, part of the Western Ghats, Chikmagalur boasts an idyllic landscape with lush green hills, cascading waterfalls, and sprawling coffee plantations. The town is located at an average elevation of 1,090 meters (3,576 feet) above sea level, offering a cool and pleasant climate throughout the year. It is approximately 243 kilometers from Bangalore, the state capital, and is a popular getaway for those seeking a respite from city life. Chikmagalur's uniqueness lies in its blend of natural beauty, rich cultural heritage, and, of course, its profound association with coffee cultivation.

### **History and Cultural Heritage**

The history of Chikmagalur is interwoven with the introduction of coffee in India. Baba Budan, a Sufi saint, is credited with bringing seven coffee beans from Yemen and planting them in the hills of Chikmagalur in the 17th century, marking the beginning of coffee cultivation in India. This act profoundly shaped the region's identity and economy.

Culturally, Chikmagalur reflects a blend of influences. The region has a rich tradition of festivals, with many celebrations coinciding with agricultural cycles. Local communities celebrate various Hindu festivals, including Diwali, Ugadi (Kannada New Year), and religious processions that are vibrant and colorful.

One notable example is the ancient Sri Sharadamba Temple at Sringeri, which is a renowned centre for Hindu philosophy and pilgrimage, located nearby.
