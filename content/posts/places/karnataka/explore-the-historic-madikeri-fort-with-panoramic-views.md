### **History and Cultural Heritage**

Madikeri's history is a tapestry woven with threads of various dynasties and influences. The region was once under the rule of the Kadambas, Gangas, Cholas, and Hoysalas before coming under the control of the Vijayanagar Empire. The Lingayat Rajas established the Kodava kingdom in the 17th century, with Madikeri as its capital. The most notable ruler was Dodda Veerarajendra, who constructed the Madikeri Fort. In 1834, the British annexed Kodagu, and the town underwent significant development under colonial rule, which included road construction, infrastructure development, and establishing coffee plantations.

The Kodava people, the indigenous community of Madikeri, have a distinct culture with unique traditions. Their martial traditions are reflected in their elaborate festivals and attire, including the traditional Kodava saree for women and the Kupya, a unique garment worn by men. The annual "Kailpodh" festival, celebrating the worship of weapons, and "Puttari," a harvest festival, are vibrant cultural events.
