### **History and Cultural Heritage**

The history of Unakoti is steeped in legend and mystery. The name "Unakoti" itself translates to "one less than a crore," suggesting the existence of nearly a crore (ten million) rock carvings. Legend has it that when Lord Shiva, on his way to Kashi, along with other gods and goddesses, stopped for the night at this place, he asked all the deities to wake up before sunrise and proceed to Kashi. However, only Shiva himself woke up, leaving the other deities to turn into stone images as a consequence of not waking up before sunrise. The carvings at Unakoti are a testament to this ancient legend, with each sculpture believed to depict a deity or a figure from Hindu mythology. The intricate carvings, depicting Shiva, Parvati, Ganesha, and other gods and goddesses, showcase the artistic brilliance of the time. The carvings, carved out of the hillsides, reflect the influence of both Hindu and possibly Buddhist traditions. The annual Ashokashtami Mela, held here, is a significant cultural event.
