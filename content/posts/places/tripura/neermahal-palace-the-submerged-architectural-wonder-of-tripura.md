### **Introduction**

Neermahal Palace, the "Lake Palace of Tripura," stands as a breathtaking testament to the opulent reign of the Manikya dynasty. Situated on the Rudrasagar Lake in Melaghar, Tripura, this magnificent palace is a stunning fusion of Hindu and Muslim architectural styles. It's a jewel in the crown of Tripura's heritage, captivating visitors with its sheer grandeur and serene setting. Located approximately 53 kilometers from Agartala, the state capital, and easily accessible, Neermahal is a popular destination for both domestic and international tourists. The palace's unique location, its striking design, and the tranquil beauty of the surrounding lake make it a truly unforgettable experience.

### **History and Cultural Heritage**

The construction of Neermahal Palace was initiated by Maharaja Bir Bikram Kishore Manikya Debbarma, the then king of Tripura, in 1921. He envisioned a summer residence for himself and his royal family. The palace was completed in 1930 after nine years of labor, crafted with red sandstone and marble, showcasing the royal's ambitious architectural vision. The design was conceived by Martin & Burns Company, a British firm.



The palace served as a cultural hub, hosting regal events, theatrical performances, and boat races. The architecture reflects a blend of Islamic and Hindu influences, creating a harmonious synthesis of styles. The palace's historical significance is not only rooted in its royal association but also in its reflection of a period of Tripura's history when modernization and cultural exchange were actively embraced. The palace's beauty is also captured in the annual Neermahal Water Festival held every year in the month of July or August.
