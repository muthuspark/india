### **History and Cultural Heritage**

Kovalam's history is intrinsically linked to the Travancore kingdom. The area served as a strategic location, and its natural harbor was used for trade. In the early 20th century, the region gained popularity, attracting the attention of the Regent Maharani Sethu Lakshmi Bayi. She built the Halcyon Castle (now a luxury hotel) in 1932, which significantly contributed to Kovalam’s development as a tourist destination. The beach, which was once a secluded spot, slowly began to attract attention from European visitors seeking a peaceful retreat.

Culturally, Kovalam reflects Kerala's rich traditions. While there aren't any major historical landmarks within Kovalam itself, nearby Thiruvananthapuram offers access to iconic sites, including the Padmanabhaswamy Temple, known for its architectural grandeur and religious significance. Local festivals, such as Onam and Vishu, are celebrated with vibrant cultural performances, traditional dances, and feasts, showcasing Kerala's heritage. Ayurvedic practices are integral to the culture; numerous centers offer treatments and therapies rooted in ancient traditions.
