Situated on the Malabar Coast, Varkala is approximately 50 kilometers (31 miles) north of Thiruvananthapuram, the state capital, and enjoys an elevation of around 50 meters (164 feet) above sea level along the cliff edges.

### **History and Cultural Heritage**

Varkala boasts a rich history, intertwined with Hindu mythology and spiritual practices. Legend says that the area derives its name from a story about a king who, after visiting the region, had his sins washed away. He requested his followers to call the place "Varkala" meaning "turned away" â€“ as in, his sins were turned away. The region has long been a pilgrimage site, especially the Janardhana Swamy Temple, one of the oldest and most revered temples in Kerala. <img src="placeholder_image_tag_janardhana_temple.jpg" alt="Janardhana Swamy Temple"> The temple is dedicated to Lord Vishnu and its location on the cliff offers panoramic views of the sea.
