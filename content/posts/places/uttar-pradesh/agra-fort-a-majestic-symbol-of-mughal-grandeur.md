### **Introduction**

Agra Fort, a UNESCO World Heritage site, is a majestic fort located in Agra, Uttar Pradesh, India. Situated on the right bank of the Yamuna River, this imposing structure stands as a testament to the grandeur of the Mughal Empire. Agra Fort is in close proximity to the iconic Taj Mahal, just a few kilometers away, making it a key destination for anyone exploring the historical heart of India. The fort's unique blend of Hindu and Islamic architectural styles, the historical significance as the former residence of Mughal Emperors, and its breathtaking views make it an unforgettable landmark. While the elevation of Agra is relatively low, the Fort itself offers elevated perspectives of the surrounding city and river.

### **History and Cultural Heritage**

Agra Fort boasts a rich history dating back to the 16th century. Initially, it was a brick fort known as Badalgarh, but it was rebuilt by the Mughal Emperor Akbar in 1565 with red sandstone, giving it its distinctive appearance. The fort served as the main residence of the Mughal Emperors until the capital was shifted to Delhi in the 17th century. The fort witnessed the reigns of several emperors, including Jahangir, Shah Jahan, and Aurangzeb, each of whom contributed to its expansion and architectural embellishments.

The cultural heritage of Agra Fort is intertwined with the traditions and customs of the Mughal era. The fort houses numerous magnificent structures such as the Diwan-i-Aam (Hall of Public Audience), Diwan-i-Khas (Hall of Private Audience), Jahangir's Palace, and Khas Mahal, each reflecting the artistic sensibilities and power of the Mughal rulers. Numerous festivals and cultural events were likely celebrated within the fort's walls, though specific records of such celebrations are scarce.
