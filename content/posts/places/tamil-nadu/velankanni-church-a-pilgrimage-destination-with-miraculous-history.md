Situated on the Coromandel Coast, approximately 350 kilometers south of Chennai, the church is one of the most visited pilgrimage sites in India, attracting millions of devotees from various religions and backgrounds annually. This sacred place is renowned for its miraculous history and stands as a symbol of faith, hope, and healing.

### **History and Cultural Heritage**

The history of Velankanni Church is steeped in legends of miracles dating back to the 16th century. The most prominent story involves three apparitions of the Virgin Mary. The first occurred in 1550 when Mary appeared to a shepherd boy delivering milk to a local landowner, asking for milk for her baby. The second apparition happened a few years later, where Mary appeared to a crippled buttermilk vendor, requesting that he build a chapel in her honor. The third apparition occurred in the 17th century when a group of Portuguese sailors, caught in a violent storm, prayed to Mary for deliverance and vowed to build a chapel upon reaching land. They successfully reached Velankanni and built a chapel, which eventually evolved into the current basilica.
