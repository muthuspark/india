Tiruvannamalai, a town steeped in spirituality and history, is nestled in the heart of Tamil Nadu, India. Located approximately 190 kilometers (118 miles) southwest of Chennai, it's a popular destination for spiritual seekers, history enthusiasts, and nature lovers alike. Situated at the base of the sacred Annamalai hills, Tiruvannamalai is renowned for its iconic Arunachaleswarar Temple, one of the largest and most significant Shiva temples in India. This ancient town, with an average elevation of around 100 meters (328 feet) above sea level, draws pilgrims and tourists year-round.
