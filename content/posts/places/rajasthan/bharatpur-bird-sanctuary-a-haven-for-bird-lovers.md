### **Introduction**

Bharatpur Bird Sanctuary, officially known as Keoladeo National Park, is a globally renowned avifauna haven nestled in the heart of Bharatpur district in Rajasthan, India. This UNESCO World Heritage site is located approximately 180 km (112 miles) south of Delhi and 55 km (34 miles) west of Agra, making it a convenient day trip or a stopover for those traveling between these popular tourist destinations. Situated at an average elevation of 174 meters (571 feet) above sea level, the sanctuary is a mosaic of wetlands, dry grasslands, woodlands, and human-modified habitats, making it a critical wintering ground for a myriad of migratory birds. Its unique appeal lies in the sheer diversity and density of birdlife, coupled with its easily accessible location and well-maintained trails, providing an unparalleled bird-watching experience.

### **History and Cultural Heritage**

The history of Keoladeo National Park is intertwined with the royal lineage of the Bharatpur princely state. Originally, the area was a natural depression, regularly flooded during the monsoon season. In the 1850s, the then-ruler of Bharatpur, Maharaja Suraj Mal, built dams and dykes to create a wetland ecosystem that would serve as a duck hunting reserve. Named after the Keoladeo (Shiva) temple within its boundaries, the sanctuary became a popular hunting ground for the royalty and the British, attracting both local and foreign dignitaries.  The practice of hunting continued until 1972 when it was banned, and the area was declared a protected sanctuary. In 1985, the sanctuary earned its UNESCO World Heritage site status, acknowledging its global significance in conservation and biodiversity. The cultural heritage of Bharatpur reflects a vibrant blend of Rajasthani traditions, with influences from the Mughal and colonial eras. Traditional music, dance, and colorful festivals are a common sight. The Keoladeo Temple, alongside other smaller temples, showcases the region's devotion to Hindu deities.  

###  **Natural Beauty**

Bharatpur Bird Sanctuary is a testament to the beauty of a managed ecosystem. The landscape is a captivating interplay of shallow freshwater marshes, wetlands, and dry grasslands. The park features a man-made system of dikes and dams that regulate water levels, creating ideal habitats for various aquatic plants and animals. The water bodies are fringed by trees such as *Kadam* and *Arjuna*, and the grasslands are dotted with scattered patches of *dhak* (flame of the forest) trees. The best viewpoints are along the network of trails, pathways, and the main road that cuts through the sanctuary. Visitors can experience exceptional views of the diverse flora and fauna from these vantage points. The areaâ€™s proximity to the Chambal River, a haven for crocodiles and other wildlife, indirectly influences the biodiversity of the sanctuary.  The park's landscape transforms dramatically with the seasons. During the monsoon, the wetlands overflow, attracting a multitude of birds, while in the winter months, the sanctuary becomes a vibrant hub for migratory species.
