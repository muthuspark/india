### **Introduction**

Jaisalmer Fort, also known as Sonar Quila (Golden Fort) due to its yellow sandstone construction that gleams in the sunlight, is a majestic citadel situated in the heart of Jaisalmer, a city in the Thar Desert of Rajasthan, India. Rising dramatically from the desert landscape, it's a breathtaking sight, a living fort where people still reside within its ancient walls. Jaisalmer Fort sits at an elevation of approximately 250 meters (820 feet) above sea level.  It is conveniently located and easily accessible from other popular Rajasthani destinations such as Jaipur and Udaipur. This UNESCO World Heritage site is unique because it's one of the very few "living forts" in the world, a fortified settlement that houses residences, shops, hotels, and temples, contributing to a vibrant cultural experience unlike any other.

### **History and Cultural Heritage**

The history of Jaisalmer Fort is deeply intertwined with the Bhati Rajput dynasty.  Founded in 1156 AD by the Rajput ruler Rawal Jaisal, the fort has witnessed centuries of battles, sieges, and prosperity.  The fort's location along important trade routes, including the ancient Silk Road, made it a valuable strategic and economic asset.  The fort has seen raids by various invaders including the Ghurid Empire. Over time, the fort's walls were fortified and strengthened. The Mughals briefly controlled Jaisalmer Fort during the Mughal empire.  Following independence, it was incorporated into the Indian state of Rajasthan.
