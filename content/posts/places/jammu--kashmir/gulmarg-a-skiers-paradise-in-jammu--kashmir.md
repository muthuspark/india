The unique blend of its natural beauty, adventure activities, and rich cultural heritage makes Gulmarg a truly unforgettable destination.

### **History and Cultural Heritage**

Gulmarg's history is interwoven with the broader narrative of the Kashmir Valley. While the area was sparsely populated for centuries, its strategic location and breathtaking beauty attracted the attention of various rulers. The name "Gulmarg" itself reflects its charm, meaning "Meadow of Flowers" in the Kashmiri language. The Mughals, known for their love of gardens, established a presence in the region. During the British colonial era, Gulmarg gained prominence as a popular summer resort, attracting Europeans who were drawn to its cool climate and stunning landscapes. They established golf courses, transforming Gulmarg into one of the highest green golf courses in the world.
