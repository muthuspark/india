## Yoga: School of Physical and Mental Discipline in Indian Philosophy

### Introduction

Yoga, in the context of Indian philosophy, is one of the six orthodox (Astika) schools of Hindu philosophy. More than just physical postures, commonly associated with it in the West, Yoga is a comprehensive system of physical, mental, and spiritual discipline aiming at self-realization and liberation (moksha) from the cycle of birth and death. The Yoga school emphasizes the practical application of philosophical principles to attain a state of union with the ultimate reality. While sharing metaphysical and epistemological foundations with Samkhya philosophy, Yoga focuses on the techniques and methods needed to achieve the separation of Purusha (pure consciousness) from Prakriti (matter), ultimately leading to liberation. Yoga's historical significance lies in its enduring influence on Indian culture, religion, and medicine, as well as its increasing global popularity as a practice promoting well-being.

### Origins and Historical Development

**Founders or Key Figures:**

While the roots of Yoga likely extend back to pre-Vedic traditions, the standardized philosophical system of Yoga is primarily attributed to Patanjali, who systematized the school in his *Yoga Sutras* around the 2nd century BCE. Patanjali is considered the "father" of classical Yoga, codifying existing practices and beliefs into a cohesive system. Other key figures include Vyasa, who wrote a commentary on the *Yoga Sutras*, and various teachers within different lineages of Yoga, such as those associated with Hatha Yoga.

**Historical Context:**

Yoga emerged within the broader intellectual and spiritual milieu of ancient India. It shares common ground with other schools of thought, including Samkhya, Buddhism, and Jainism, absorbing and adapting various elements from these traditions. The cultural context was characterized by a growing emphasis on introspection, self-discipline, and the pursuit of spiritual liberation. Politically and socially, India during this period was undergoing significant transformations, with the rise and fall of various empires and the development of complex social structures. These factors contributed to the development of diverse spiritual practices and philosophical systems, including Yoga.

**Key Texts or Scriptures:**

*   **Yoga Sutras of Patanjali:** The foundational text of classical Yoga, outlining the eight limbs (Ashtanga) of Yoga as a path to liberation.
*   **Bhagavad Gita:** While not exclusively a Yoga text, it integrates different paths to liberation, including Karma Yoga (the path of action), Bhakti Yoga (the path of devotion), and Jnana Yoga (the path of knowledge). These paths are often considered integral aspects of Yoga philosophy.
*   **Hatha Yoga Pradipika:** A 15th-century text that outlines the principles and practices of Hatha Yoga, a more physically oriented branch of Yoga.
*   **Yoga Vasistha:** A lengthy philosophical poem offering a detailed explanation of Advaita Vedanta philosophy through the lens of Yoga.

**Evolution over Time and Major Schools or Branches:**

Yoga has evolved significantly over time, resulting in various schools and branches. Key stages in its evolution include:

*   **Pre-Patanjali Yoga:** Practices and beliefs existing prior to Patanjali's codification, likely rooted in ancient ascetic traditions.
*   **Classical Yoga (Raja Yoga):** The system articulated in the *Yoga Sutras*, emphasizing mental discipline, meditation, and the eight limbs of Yoga.
*   **Hatha Yoga:** Developed later, emphasizing physical postures (asanas), breath control (pranayama), and other physical techniques to purify the body and prepare it for deeper meditation.
*   **Tantra Yoga:** Incorporates Tantric philosophy and practices, often involving complex rituals and visualizations.
*   **Modern Yoga:** Includes various contemporary styles of Yoga that have emerged in the 20th and 21st centuries, often focusing on physical fitness and stress reduction.

### Core Doctrines and Beliefs

**Central Metaphysical and Epistemological Ideas:**

Yoga shares a dualistic metaphysics with Samkhya, positing two fundamental realities: Purusha (pure consciousness or Self) and Prakriti (matter or nature). Purusha is inactive and unattached, while Prakriti is active and constantly evolving. The illusion that Purusha is bound to Prakriti is the root cause of suffering. The goal of Yoga is to achieve Kaivalya, the complete separation of Purusha from Prakriti, resulting in liberation.

Epistemologically, Yoga relies on pratyaksha (direct perception), anumana (inference), and agama (scriptural testimony) as valid sources of knowledge. However, it emphasizes the importance of developing intuition and direct experience through yogic practices to gain deeper insight into the nature of reality.

**Key Concepts and Terminology:**

*   **Dharma:** Righteous conduct, moral duty, and cosmic law.
*   **Karma:** The law of cause and effect, where actions create consequences that shape future experiences.
*   **Moksha:** Liberation from the cycle of birth and death, the ultimate goal of Yoga.
*   **Kaivalya:** The state of complete isolation or liberation of Purusha from Prakriti, unique to Yoga philosophy.
*   **Purusha:** Pure consciousness, the true Self, distinct from matter.
*   **Prakriti:** Matter, nature, the source of all physical and mental phenomena.
*   **Ashtanga:** The eight limbs of Yoga, as described in the Yoga Sutras: Yama (ethical restraints), Niyama (observances), Asana (postures), Pranayama (breath control), Pratyahara (sense withdrawal), Dharana (concentration), Dhyana (meditation), and Samadhi (absorption).
*   **Samadhi:** A state of deep absorption and union with the object of meditation.
*   **Chitta:** The mind-stuff, the mental field that needs to be controlled and purified.
*   **Kleshas:** The five afflictions that cause suffering: ignorance (avidya), egoism (asmita), attachment (raga), aversion (dvesha), and clinging to life (abhinivesha).

**View of the Self, Reality, and Liberation:**

Yoga posits that the true Self (Purusha) is pure, unchanging consciousness. However, due to ignorance (avidya), it identifies with the ever-changing mind and body (Prakriti). This identification leads to suffering. Reality is a complex interplay of Purusha and Prakriti. Liberation is achieved when the illusion of identification is dispelled, and Purusha realizes its true nature as separate from Prakriti. This realization is attained through disciplined practice of the eight limbs of Yoga, which gradually purify the mind and reveal the true Self.

### Ethical Teachings and Practices

**Moral Principles or Ethical Codes:**

The ethical foundation of Yoga is rooted in the Yamas and Niyamas, the first two limbs of Ashtanga Yoga.

*   **Yamas (Ethical Restraints):**
    *   Ahimsa (non-violence)
    *   Satya (truthfulness)
    *   Asteya (non-stealing)
    *   Brahmacharya (continence/moderation)
    *   Aparigraha (non-possessiveness)

*   **Niyamas (Observances):**
    *   Saucha (purity)
    *   Santosha (contentment)
    *   Tapas (self-discipline/austerity)
    *   Svadhyaya (self-study)
    *   Ishvara Pranidhana (surrender to a higher power)

**Rituals, Practices, Meditation, or Disciplines:**

*   **Asanas (Postures):** Physical postures designed to purify the body, improve health, and prepare the mind for meditation.
*   **Pranayama (Breath Control):** Techniques for regulating the breath to calm the mind, increase energy, and promote well-being.
*   **Pratyahara (Sense Withdrawal):** Turning the attention inward, away from external stimuli.
*   **Dharana (Concentration):** Focusing the mind on a single object or point of attention.
*   **Dhyana (Meditation):** Sustained concentration, a state of effortless flow and absorption.
*   **Samadhi (Absorption):** The ultimate goal of Yoga, a state of profound absorption and union with the object of meditation.
*   **Mantras:** Sacred sounds or syllables used to focus the mind and deepen meditation.
*   **Mudras:** Symbolic hand gestures used to channel energy and enhance meditation.

**Daily Life Guidance and Societal Implications:**

The ethical principles of Yoga, particularly the Yamas and Niyamas, provide a framework for ethical conduct in daily life. They promote compassion, honesty, self-discipline, and contentment, encouraging individuals to live in harmony with themselves, others, and the environment. Yoga's emphasis on self-awareness and self-regulation can also have positive societal implications, fostering greater empathy, understanding, and cooperation.

### Major Schools and Variations

As mentioned earlier, Yoga has various schools and branches, each with its own emphasis and approach.

*   **Classical Yoga (Raja Yoga):** Based on the *Yoga Sutras*, emphasizing the eight limbs and mental discipline.
*   **Hatha Yoga:** Focuses on physical postures, breath control, and other physical techniques. Popular styles include Iyengar, Ashtanga Vinyasa, Bikram, and Vinyasa Flow.
*   **Karma Yoga:** The path of selfless action, performing one's duties without attachment to the results.
*   **Bhakti Yoga:** The path of devotion, cultivating love and surrender to a higher power.
*   **Jnana Yoga:** The path of knowledge, using intellectual inquiry and discrimination to realize the true nature of reality.
*   **Tantra Yoga:** Incorporates Tantric philosophy and practices, often involving complex rituals and visualizations.

The key differences between these schools lie in their emphasis and approach to liberation. Classical Yoga emphasizes mental discipline, while Hatha Yoga focuses on physical practices. Karma Yoga emphasizes selfless action, Bhakti Yoga emphasizes devotion, and Jnana Yoga emphasizes knowledge. Tantra Yoga integrates various practices and rituals to achieve liberation.
