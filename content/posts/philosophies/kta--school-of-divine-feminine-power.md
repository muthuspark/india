## Śākta: School of Divine Feminine Power

**Introduction**

Śākta (Sanskrit: शाक्त, lit. "power" or "energy") is a Hindu denomination and philosophical system that centers on the worship of Śakti, the Divine Feminine, understood as the ultimate reality and the dynamic force behind the universe. It posits that Śakti, personified in various goddesses, is the source of all creation, preservation, and destruction. Śākta philosophy provides a comprehensive framework for understanding existence, encompassing metaphysics, ethics, and ritual practices aimed at realizing union with the Divine Feminine. Śākta represents a significant strand within Hinduism, impacting various aspects of Indian culture and continuing to be practiced today.

**Historical Significance and Relevance:** The Śākta tradition offers a unique perspective by elevating the female principle to the position of supreme deity. This has important implications for understanding gender roles, power dynamics, and the nature of reality itself. Its influence is visible in art, literature, temple architecture, and social customs across the Indian subcontinent.

### Origins and Historical Development

**Founders or Key Figures:** Śākta, unlike some other schools, doesn't typically ascribe its origins to a single identifiable founder. Instead, its development is intertwined with ancient folk traditions, Tantric practices, and the assimilation of indigenous goddess worship into the broader Hindu framework. While no single founder exists, influential figures include:

*   **Matsyendranath:** Considered a founder of the Kaula tradition, a form of Tantric Śākta.
*   **Gorakshanath:** A key figure in the Nath tradition, which influenced Śākta practices.
*   **Śankarācārya (Adi Shankara):** Though primarily known for his Advaita Vedanta philosophy, he is believed to have composed hymns dedicated to Śakti, suggesting an integration of Śākta elements into his thought. His *Saundarya Lahari* is a popular hymn to the goddess Tripura Sundari.

**Historical Context:** Śākta's development is inextricably linked to the history of Tantra, with its roots possibly traceable to pre-Vedic indigenous traditions centered around fertility and earth goddesses. The historical context includes:

*   **Pre-Vedic Era (before 1500 BCE):** Evidence suggests the worship of mother goddesses in the Indus Valley Civilization and other pre-Vedic cultures.
*   **Vedic Period (1500-500 BCE):** While the Vedic deities are primarily male, some subtle references to female power exist. Goddesses like Aditi and Ushas begin to appear.
*   **Epic Period (500 BCE - 500 CE):** The *Mahabharata* and *Ramayana* contain more prominent roles for goddesses, such as Durga and Sita.
*   **Puranic Period (300 CE onwards):** The *Devi Mahatmya* (part of the *Markandeya Purana*) is a key text that establishes the supremacy of the Goddess Durga and becomes a foundational text for Śākta. This period witnesses the systematization of Śākta theology and rituals.
*   **Tantric Period (6th century CE onwards):** Tantric practices, emphasizing ritual and direct experience, become increasingly intertwined with Śākta beliefs.

**Key Texts or Scriptures:** Śākta literature is vast and diverse, encompassing Vedas, Agamas, Puranas, and Tantras. Key texts include:

*   **Vedas:** Especially the *Rigveda*, with hymns containing seeds of goddess worship.
*   **Agamas (especially Tantric Agamas):** These texts provide detailed instructions on rituals, mantras, and visualizations. Examples include the *Kulārnava Tantra*, *Mahānirvana Tantra*, and *Tantrāloka*.
*   **Puranas:** The *Devi Mahatmya* is the most important Purana for Śāktas, but other Puranas like the *Kalika Purana* and *Devi Bhagavata Purana* also provide significant theological and mythological narratives.
*   **Saundarya Lahari:** Attributed to Adi Shankaracharya, this hymn celebrates the beauty and power of the goddess Tripura Sundari.

**Evolution over time and major schools or branches:** Śākta has evolved over centuries, leading to different schools with varying emphasis on theology and practice:

*   **Śrīkula:** Focuses on the worship of Śrī or Lalita Tripura Sundari and emphasizes beauty, prosperity, and spiritual realization. Uses the Śrī Cakra as a central symbol.
*   **Kālīkula:** Centers on the worship of Kali, often emphasizing the fierce and transformative aspects of the Divine Feminine. Often associated with cremation grounds and more radical practices.
*   **Trika:** A non-dualistic Kashmiri Śaiva school that integrates Śākta elements and views the universe as a manifestation of the divine consciousness.
*   **Kaula:** A Tantric tradition emphasizing ritual and the transcendence of social norms to achieve liberation.

### Core Doctrines and Beliefs

**Central metaphysical and epistemological ideas:**

*   **Śakti as Supreme Reality:** The core belief is that Śakti, the Divine Feminine, is the ultimate reality ( Brahman ). She is the source of all creation, preservation, and destruction. She is both immanent (present within the universe) and transcendent (beyond the universe).
*   **Śiva as Passive Consciousness:** While Śiva is often depicted as Śakti's consort, in Śākta philosophy, he is typically considered the passive aspect of reality, while Śakti is the active, dynamic force.
*   **Maya (Illusion):** The world is considered a manifestation of Śakti's power and also an illusion that obscures the true nature of reality.
*   **Epistemology:** Knowledge (Jnana) is essential for liberation. Śākta texts emphasize both scriptural knowledge and direct experience (Anubhava) gained through ritual, meditation, and devotion. Tantric practices are considered particularly effective in achieving direct realization.

**Key concepts and terminology:**

*   **Śakti:** Divine feminine energy, the active principle of reality.
*   **Śiva:** Pure consciousness, the passive principle of reality.
*   **Maya:** Illusion, the veiling power of Śakti that obscures the true nature of reality.
*   **Kundalini:** The latent energy coiled at the base of the spine, which can be awakened through practices like yoga and meditation.
*   **Cakra:** Energy centers located along the spine, associated with different aspects of consciousness.
*   **Mantra:** Sacred sounds or syllables used in meditation and ritual.
*   **Yantra:** Geometric diagrams used as focal points for meditation and visualization.
*   **Dharma:** Righteous conduct, duty, and cosmic order.
*   **Karma:** The law of cause and effect.
*   **Moksha:** Liberation from the cycle of rebirth.
*   **Nirvana:** While primarily a Buddhist concept, the idea of liberation from suffering is also present in Śākta thought.

**View of the self, reality, and liberation:**

*   **The Self (Atman):** The individual self is ultimately identical with Śakti. Ignorance of this truth leads to suffering.
*   **Reality:** Reality is not dualistic. Śiva and Śakti are inseparable aspects of the same ultimate reality. The phenomenal world is a manifestation of Śakti's divine play (Lila).
*   **Liberation (Moksha):** Liberation is achieved through the realization of one's true nature as Śakti. This can be accomplished through various practices, including devotion, ritual, meditation, and the guidance of a Guru.

### Ethical Teachings and Practices

**Moral principles or ethical codes:** Śākta ethics are generally aligned with broader Hindu principles. Key principles include:

*   **Ahimsa (Non-violence):** Although some Tantric practices may involve symbolic or ritualized violence, the principle of non-violence is generally emphasized.
*   **Satya (Truthfulness):** Honesty and integrity are considered essential for spiritual progress.
*   **Asteya (Non-stealing):** Respecting the property and rights of others.
*   **Brahmacharya (Celibacy or moderation):** In some traditions, celibacy is practiced, while others emphasize the controlled channeling of sexual energy.
*   **Aparigraha (Non-attachment):** Reducing material possessions and cultivating detachment from worldly desires.

**Rituals, practices, meditation, or disciplines:**

*   **Puja (Worship):** Daily or occasional worship of the chosen deity (Ishta-Devata) through offerings, prayers, and hymns.
*   **Mantra Japa (Recitation of Mantras):** Repeating sacred mantras to invoke the deity's power.
*   **Yantra Meditation:** Focusing on geometric diagrams to deepen meditation.
*   **Yoga and Pranayama:** Practicing physical postures and breathing exercises to purify the body and mind.
*   **Tantric Rituals:** In some Śākta traditions, Tantric rituals involving the use of forbidden substances or sexual practices are performed under the guidance of a qualified Guru to transcend social norms and realize the divine. These are often misunderstood and not universally practiced.
*   **Fire Sacrifice (Homa):** Offering oblations into a sacred fire to invoke the deities.

**Daily life guidance and societal implications:** Śākta philosophy emphasizes the importance of recognizing the Divine Feminine in all aspects of life. This can lead to a greater appreciation for women and a more balanced view of gender roles. It encourages individuals to live ethically, practice self-discipline, and strive for spiritual growth. The social implications vary depending on the specific tradition and its interpretation of Tantric principles.

### Major Schools and Variations

*   **Śrīkula:** Focuses on the worship of Śrī or Lalita Tripura Sundari, considered the supreme goddess. The Śrī Cakra is the central symbol, and the *Saundarya Lahari* is a revered text. Śrīkula emphasizes beauty, prosperity, and spiritual realization through devotion and ritual.
*   **Kālīkula:** Centers on the worship of Kali, the fierce and transformative goddess. Kālīkula often involves practices that challenge conventional social norms and focus on the destruction of ego and the realization of the ultimate reality.
*   **Trika:**  A non-dualistic Kashmiri Śaiva school that integrates Śākta elements.  It views the universe as a manifestation of divine consciousness, with Śiva and Śakti being inseparable aspects of the same reality.
*   **Differences and Similarities:** All schools acknowledge Śakti as the supreme power. The main differences lie in the specific deity worshiped, the emphasis on specific practices (like Tantric rituals), and the interpretation of key philosophical concepts.  They all share the goal of liberation through the realization of one's true nature as divine.
