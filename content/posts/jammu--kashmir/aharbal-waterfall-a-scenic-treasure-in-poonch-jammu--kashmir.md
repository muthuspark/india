### **Introduction**

Aharbal Waterfall, often dubbed the "Niagara Falls of Kashmir," is a breathtaking cascade of the Veshav River, located in the Shopian district of Jammu and Kashmir, India.  This majestic waterfall is renowned for its powerful rush of water and stunning natural beauty. While the main Aharbal Waterfall is the most prominent attraction, the area surrounding it offers a rich tapestry of natural wonders.  The waterfall plunges from a height of approximately 25 meters, creating a spectacle that captivates visitors and provides a haven for nature enthusiasts. The site is situated at an elevation of around 2,270 meters (7,450 feet) above sea level. It's a relatively secluded destination, providing a tranquil escape from the more crowded tourist spots in Kashmir. Though primarily associated with Shopian district, access and sometimes perception places it often as a part of the Poonch region in Jammu and Kashmir.

The local culture is rooted in traditional Kashmiri values, with hospitality and community spirit being central.
