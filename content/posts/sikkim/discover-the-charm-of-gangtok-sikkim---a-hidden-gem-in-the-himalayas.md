Gangtok, though not always the capital, gradually gained prominence. The construction of the Enchey Monastery in 1840 marked a significant turning point, establishing Gangtok as a religious center. In 1894, Gangtok became the administrative center of Sikkim during the British Raj, a role it retained even after India's independence.

The cultural landscape of Gangtok is predominantly influenced by the Bhutia and Lepcha communities, with strong ties to Tibetan Buddhism. The city is dotted with numerous monasteries, temples, and stupas, showcasing vibrant prayer flags, intricately carved wood, and colorful murals. The Losar (Tibetan New Year), Saga Dawa (commemorating Buddha's birth and enlightenment), and Bumchu (a sacred water festival) are some of the most celebrated festivals, offering glimpses into the spiritual life of the community.
