### **Introduction**

Kangla Fort, a historical and archaeological site of immense significance, stands as a proud testament to the rich history and cultural heritage of Manipur, India. Situated in the heart of Imphal, the capital city of Manipur, the fort is strategically located on the western bank of the Imphal River, locally known as the *Nambul River*. Though its exact elevation is not precisely documented, it occupies a prime position in the city. The fort is easily accessible, lying close to other popular destinations within Imphal such as the Shree Govindajee Temple and the Imphal War Cemetery. What makes Kangla Fort truly unique is its role as the historical seat of power for the Meitei rulers for centuries and its subsequent occupation by colonial forces, marking a significant intersection of indigenous sovereignty and colonial influence. It offers visitors a compelling glimpse into the past, blending history, culture, and architectural grandeur within its ancient walls.

### **History and Cultural Heritage**

Kangla Fort boasts a deeply rooted history, tracing back to ancient times as the traditional seat of the Meitei kings. The fort's significance extends far beyond mere administrative purposes; it was a sacred place, representing the very soul of Manipur. It's believed to have been inhabited as early as the 15th century, though the exact date of its first construction is debated among historians. The fort has witnessed the reigns of numerous rulers, including the prominent King Garibaniwaj (1709-1748), who significantly expanded and enhanced its structures.

During the colonial era, Kangla Fort became a focal point of contention. The British East India Company gained control of the fort in the 19th century following the Anglo-Manipuri War of 1891. For the next several decades, it served as the headquarters for the Assam Rifles, further altering its landscape and the cultural context. The fort has hosted various important religious and cultural festivals throughout the centuries, and continues to be the venue for many such activities. The fort also houses significant religious sites, including the Kangla Sha (the sacred crocodile) and a temple dedicated to the deity Pakhangba, which are integral to the Meitei religious practices. Key historical events linked to the fort include the formal annexation of Manipur by the British and the later struggle for independence.
