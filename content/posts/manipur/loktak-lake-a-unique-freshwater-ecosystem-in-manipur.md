### **History and Cultural Heritage**

The history of Loktak Lake is intertwined with the history of Manipur. For centuries, it has been a vital source of sustenance and a spiritual sanctuary for the Meitei people, the dominant ethnic group of Manipur. The lake holds deep cultural significance, often appearing in local folklore, legends, and traditional practices. The phumdis themselves are intrinsically linked to the local lifestyle, providing natural platforms for fishing, habitation, and resource gathering. The Keibul Lamjao National Park, situated on the southeastern shore of the lake, holds immense historical and ecological importance, as it's the last natural habitat of the endangered Sangai deer (brow-antlered deer), Manipur's state animal. The lake area has also witnessed historical events, including conflicts and the rise and fall of kingdoms, reflected in the customs, traditions, and practices of the people surrounding Loktak. The Meitei people have a long tradition of water management and resource conservation, which reflects their deep respect for Loktak and its resources. Cultural practices and festivals are often centered around the lake's bounty and its significance in their lives. <img src="placeholder_loktak_lake_history.jpg" alt="Loktak Lake - History and Cultural Heritage">
