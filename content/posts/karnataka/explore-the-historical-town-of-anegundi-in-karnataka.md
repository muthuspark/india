Steeped in mythology and history, Anegundi offers a serene and less-crowded alternative to the bustling Hampi, providing a unique glimpse into the region's rich past. It's located in the Koppal district of Karnataka, at an elevation of approximately 400 meters (1312 feet).

### **History and Cultural Heritage**

Anegundi is steeped in legends dating back to the Ramayana. It is believed to be Kishkindha, the kingdom of the monkey king, Sugriva. The region has a continuous history stretching back to the pre-Vijayanagara period. In the 14th century, after the fall of the Kakatiya dynasty, the Vijayanagara Empire rose to power, and Anegundi served as a strategic stronghold and even a temporary capital before the city of Vijayanagara (Hampi) was fully established.

Anegundi witnessed the rule of various dynasties, including the Chalukyas, and Hoyasalas, before its eventual incorporation into the Vijayanagara Empire. This rich history is reflected in the many temples, monuments, and archaeological sites scattered throughout the town. The cultural landscape is marked by vibrant festivals and traditions, some of which are unique to the region. The local population primarily follows Hinduism, and the temples here showcase a distinct architectural style, often blending Dravidian and local influences. Key historical landmarks include the Anegundi Fort, the Pampa Sarovar (believed to be where Shabari, a devotee of Rama, waited for him), and the Ranganatha Temple.

The Tungabhadra River, flowing gracefully along its banks, adds to the scenic beauty, offering breathtaking vistas, especially during sunrise and sunset.
