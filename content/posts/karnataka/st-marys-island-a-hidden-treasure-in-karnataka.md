### **Introduction**

St. Mary's Island, also known as Coconut Island and Thonsepar, is a set of four small islands in the Arabian Sea off the coast of Malpe, Karnataka, India. These islands, known for their unique geological formations of basalt rocks crystallized into columnar shapes, are a geological marvel and a haven of tranquility. Located approximately 4 km from Malpe, they are a popular day trip destination for tourists and researchers alike. With no significant elevation, these islands are renowned for their pristine beaches, clear waters, and the mesmerizing views they offer, particularly at sunset. St. Mary's Island is a designated National Geological Monument, recognized by the Geological Survey of India.

### **History and Cultural Heritage**

The history of St. Mary's Island is intertwined with the broader maritime history of the region. While specific historical records about these islands are scarce, they are believed to have been used by sailors and traders navigating the Arabian Sea for centuries. One of the most significant historical anecdotes associated with the islands is the claim that Vasco da Gama, the Portuguese explorer, first landed on St. Mary's Island in 1498 on his way to India, and erected a cross. This connection has given the islands a degree of historical prominence.

The cultural heritage of the area is largely influenced by the local communities residing in and around Malpe. These communities, largely of the Tulu and Kannada cultures, have a rich heritage of coastal traditions, fishing practices, and vibrant cultural celebrations. While there are no permanent settlements on the islands, the local fishermen from Malpe play a crucial role in facilitating tourism and maintaining the island's natural beauty.

### **Natural Beauty**

St. Mary's Island's most defining feature is its unique geological composition. The islands are primarily composed of basalt rocks that have crystallized into distinct, columnar formations. These formations, often hexagonal in shape, are a result of the rapid cooling of molten lava. <img src="placeholder_image_1.jpg" alt="Columnar Basalt Formations" style="max-width: 600px;"> The beaches on these islands, particularly on the main island, are stunning. They are characterized by pristine white sand, clear turquoise waters, and the gentle sounds of the Arabian Sea. The views from the island are breathtaking, offering panoramic vistas of the sea and the surrounding coastline. The sunsets here are especially mesmerizing, with the vibrant hues of the sky reflecting on the water and the basalt columns creating a dramatic silhouette.

The islands are a vital habitat for various marine species, including crabs, sea shells, and a variety of seabirds. Although the vegetation is sparse, mostly consisting of coconut palms (hence the name Coconut Island), the natural beauty of the islands is in their geological uniqueness and the tranquil coastal environment.
