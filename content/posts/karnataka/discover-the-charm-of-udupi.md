### **Introduction**

Udupi, a serene coastal town nestled in the Udupi district of Karnataka, India, is a place steeped in spirituality, tradition, and natural beauty. Located on the southwest coast, Udupi overlooks the Arabian Sea, offering a tranquil escape from the bustling city life. The town sits at an elevation of approximately 25 meters (82 feet) above sea level. Its proximity to popular destinations like Mangalore (60 km) and the Western Ghats makes it a convenient and appealing travel destination. Udupi is renowned for its iconic Sri Krishna Matha (temple), its delicious cuisine, and its pristine beaches. The town's unique charm lies in its blend of religious devotion, rich cultural heritage, and stunning coastal landscapes.

### **History and Cultural Heritage**

Udupi's history is deeply intertwined with the Sri Krishna Matha, founded in the 13th century by the Vaishnava saint Madhvacharya. Legend states that Madhvacharya manifested the idol of Lord Krishna, which continues to be the focal point of the temple and its daily rituals. Udupi's culture is heavily influenced by the Madhva philosophy, emphasizing Dvaita (dualism) and devotion to Lord Vishnu. The eight monasteries (Ashta Mathas) established by Madhvacharya play a significant role in the temple's management and the organization of its various festivals and ceremonies.

The annual Paryaya festival, held every two years, sees the transfer of the temple's management between the eight mathas. This is a grand spectacle of religious and cultural significance, drawing pilgrims and tourists from all over India. The town is also home to several other temples and religious sites, reflecting its vibrant spiritual heritage. The local traditions include Yakshagana, a traditional theater form, and other folk dances and performances that celebrate the region's rich cultural tapestry. The influence of the Tulu language and culture is also prominent in Udupi.
