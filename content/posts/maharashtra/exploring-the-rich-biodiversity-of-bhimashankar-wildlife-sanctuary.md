### **Introduction**

Bhimashankar Wildlife Sanctuary, nestled in the Western Ghats of Maharashtra, is a verdant paradise renowned for its biodiversity and the sacred Bhimashankar Jyotirlinga temple. Situated in the Ambegaon and Khed talukas of Pune district, the sanctuary sprawls across a rugged terrain, offering a sanctuary for a variety of flora and fauna. Its elevation, ranging from 2,100 to 3,800 feet (640 to 1,170 meters), contributes to its cool and pleasant climate, making it a popular destination for nature enthusiasts and pilgrims alike. The sanctuary's proximity to Mumbai (approx. 220 km) and Pune (approx. 110 km) makes it easily accessible for weekend getaways. What makes Bhimashankar unique is its rich biological diversity, its spiritual significance, and its dramatic landscape, making it a haven for wildlife and a place of tranquility for visitors.

### **History and Cultural Heritage**

The region’s history is deeply intertwined with the legend of the Bhimashankar Jyotirlinga, one of the twelve Jyotirlingas of Lord Shiva. According to Hindu mythology, the deity Shiva, after a fierce battle with the demon Tripurasura, is believed to have manifested as a Jyotirlinga here. This religious significance has shaped the cultural landscape, with the temple serving as the focal point of the community. The temple itself, a harmonious blend of old and new architectural styles, likely evolved over centuries, reflecting various influences. The surrounding villages, inhabited primarily by local communities, preserve traditional practices, rituals, and festivals. These include the Mahashivaratri festival, which sees a massive influx of devotees. The historical background is intertwined with the natural history, as the sanctuary’s preservation is indirectly linked to the temple and the surrounding forest cover's sanctity.
