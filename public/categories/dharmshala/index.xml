      <description>&lt;h3 id=&#34;introduction&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Introduction&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;McLeod Ganj, also often spelled McLeodganj, is a charming hill station nestled in the Kangra district of Himachal Pradesh, India. Situated in the upper reaches of Dharmshala, this vibrant town is known as &amp;ldquo;Little Lhasa&amp;rdquo; due to its significant Tibetan population and cultural influence. Perched at an elevation of approximately 2,082 meters (6,831 feet), McLeod Ganj offers breathtaking views of the Dhauladhar mountain range, making it a popular destination for both spiritual seekers and adventure enthusiasts. Its proximity to other popular destinations like Dharmshala and Kangra Valley adds to its appeal. What makes McLeod Ganj truly unique is the blend of Tibetan and Indian cultures, the presence of the Dalai Lama, and the tranquil atmosphere that pervades the town, attracting visitors from around the globe.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
