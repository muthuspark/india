      <description>&lt;h3 id=&#34;introduction&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Introduction&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Chitrakoot, straddling the border between Uttar Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh, is a city steeped in mythology and history. Located in the Chitrakoot district of Madhya Pradesh, this sacred site is nestled amidst the Vindhya mountain range, offering a serene and spiritually rich experience. While the city itself is located in Madhya Pradesh, its significance and cultural influence extend across both states. Chitrakoot is known for its lush green hills, the sacred Mandakini River, and its deep connection to the Ramayana. It is a place where, according to legend, Lord Rama, his wife Sita, and his brother Lakshmana spent eleven and a half years of their exile. This association has made Chitrakoot a significant pilgrimage site for Hindus, attracting devotees and travelers alike.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
