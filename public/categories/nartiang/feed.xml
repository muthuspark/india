&lt;p&gt;The Nartiang Monoliths, a cluster of standing stones nestled in the Jaintia Hills district of Meghalaya, India, is a testament to the rich cultural heritage and intriguing history of the region. Situated in Nartiang, the site offers a glimpse into the ancient practices and beliefs of the Jaintia people. Located approximately 60 km from the state capital, Shillong, and around 35 km from Jowai, the district headquarters, Nartiang is easily accessible and often visited as part of a broader Meghalaya itinerary. The monoliths, rising against the backdrop of the lush green hills, stand as silent witnesses to centuries of traditions and offer a unique and captivating experience.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
