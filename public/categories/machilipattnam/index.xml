      <description>&lt;h3 id=&#34;introduction&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Introduction&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Ethipothala Falls, a breathtaking natural wonder, cascades down from a height of approximately 70 feet into the Krishna River. Located in the Guntur district of Andhra Pradesh, India, the falls are situated roughly 18 km from Nagarjuna Sagar Dam and approximately 150 km from Machilipatnam, making it a popular day-trip destination for tourists and locals alike. The falls are particularly stunning during the monsoon season (July to October), when the volume of water is at its peak. What makes Ethipothala Falls unique is its picturesque setting, framed by lush green hills and the subsequent formation of a small crocodile breeding centre at the bottom of the falls, creating a serene and ecologically interesting locale.&#xA;&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>
