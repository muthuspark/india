      <description>&lt;h3 id=&#34;introduction&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Introduction&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Dholavira, a remarkable archaeological site located on the Khadir Bet island in the Kutch district of Gujarat, is a testament to the ingenuity and advanced urban planning of the Indus Valley Civilization, also known as the Harappan Civilization.  While the request mentioned Bhavnagar, it&amp;rsquo;s important to note that Dholavira is actually situated in the Kutch district, a significant geographic and historical distinction. It’s a UNESCO World Heritage Site, offering visitors a glimpse into a meticulously planned city that thrived over 4,500 years ago.  The site lies on an island in the Great Rann of Kutch. The nearest major city is Bhuj, approximately 250 kilometers away. Dholavira’s isolation, its well-preserved urban layout, unique water management systems, and the artifacts discovered here make it a unique and invaluable window into the ancient world.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
