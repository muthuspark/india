&lt;p&gt;Yercaud, often hailed as the &amp;ldquo;Jewel of the South,&amp;rdquo; is a serene hill station nestled in the Shevaroy Hills of Tamil Nadu, South India. Located in the Salem district, Yercaud is perched at an altitude of approximately 4,970 feet (1,515 meters) above sea level. It offers a cool, pleasant climate and breathtaking vistas, making it a popular escape from the tropical heat of the plains. Its proximity to the bustling city of Salem (approximately 30 km away) and other popular destinations like Bangalore (around 200 km) and Chennai (about 360 km), makes it easily accessible for a weekend getaway or a longer vacation. What sets Yercaud apart is its untouched natural beauty, verdant coffee plantations, vibrant flora and fauna, and a relaxed atmosphere that offers respite from the everyday hustle.
