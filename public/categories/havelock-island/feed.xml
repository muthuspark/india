&lt;p&gt;Radhanagar Beach, situated on Havelock Island in the Andaman and Nicobar Islands, India, is renowned globally for its pristine beauty and breathtaking sunsets. Ranked as one of the world&amp;rsquo;s most beautiful beaches, Radhanagar is a jewel of the Bay of Bengal, offering an unparalleled experience for beach lovers and adventure seekers alike. Havelock Island, where the beach is located, is part of the South Andaman district and lies approximately 40 nautical miles (74 kilometers) northeast of Port Blair, the capital city of the Andaman and Nicobar Islands.
