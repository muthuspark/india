&lt;p&gt;Kolli Hills, also known as Kolli Malai, is a verdant mountain range located in the Namakkal district of Tamil Nadu, India. Perched at an average elevation of 1,350 meters (4,430 ft), this enchanting destination is a haven of natural beauty, offering a refreshing escape from the hustle and bustle of city life. Unlike its more commercialized counterparts, Kolli Hills retains a raw, untamed charm, boasting lush green landscapes, cascading waterfalls, and ancient temples. The hills are approximately 280 km from Chennai and 200 km from Coimbatore, making it an accessible weekend getaway. What makes Kolli Hills unique is its unspoiled environment, rich tribal culture, and the legendary tales of the Kolli Paavai, a mythical deity.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
