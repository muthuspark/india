&lt;p&gt;Bylakuppe Tibetan Settlement, nestled in the serene landscapes of Bylakuppe in the Indian state of Karnataka, is a vibrant and significant center of Tibetan culture outside of Tibet. This captivating settlement, located approximately 80 kilometers from Mysore and about 220 kilometers from Bangalore, stands as the second-largest Tibetan settlement in India. Unlike a typical tourist spot, Bylakuppe offers a deeply immersive cultural experience, providing a glimpse into the rich traditions, spiritual practices, and artistic expressions of the Tibetan community. Though its elevation is relatively modest within the region, its significance is monumental, offering a unique cultural immersion that separates it from many of its Karnataka counterparts.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
