&lt;p&gt;Pulwama, nestled in the heart of the Kashmir Valley, is a district in the Indian union territory of Jammu and Kashmir, often referred to as the &amp;ldquo;Rice Bowl of Kashmir&amp;rdquo; due to its fertile lands. Situated approximately 30 kilometers (19 miles) south of Srinagar, the summer capital of Jammu and Kashmir, Pulwama offers a captivating blend of serene landscapes, rich cultural heritage, and the warmth of its resilient people. While elevation varies across the district, it mirrors the typical Kashmiri valley environment. The area&amp;rsquo;s proximity to other popular destinations like Gulmarg and Pahalgam makes it an ideal base for exploring the wider region. What makes Pulwama unique is its tranquil beauty, exemplified by vibrant saffron fields, apple orchards, and traditional villages, offering a glimpse into the authentic Kashmiri way of life.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
