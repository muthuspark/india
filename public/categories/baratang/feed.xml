&lt;p&gt;Baratang Island, nestled within the larger Baratang administrative region of the Andaman &amp;amp; Nicobar Islands, is a captivating destination that seamlessly blends natural wonders with cultural intrigue. Situated roughly 100 kilometers (62 miles) north of Port Blair, the capital of the Andaman and Nicobar Islands, Baratang offers a unique ecosystem and a glimpse into the less-explored beauty of this archipelago. The island&amp;rsquo;s elevation is relatively low, with a gently undulating terrain dominated by lush rainforests and mangroves. Its proximity to other popular destinations such as Havelock Island and Neil Island adds to its appeal, making it an ideal stop for a diverse Andaman adventure. Baratang is unique due to its intriguing mix of the natural wonders like limestone caves and mangrove creeks alongside the indigenous Jarawa tribal reserves.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
