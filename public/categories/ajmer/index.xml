      <description>&lt;h3 id=&#34;introduction&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Introduction&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Pushkar Lake, a sacred haven nestled in the heart of Rajasthan, India, is a site of immense religious and cultural significance. Located in the Ajmer district, approximately 14 kilometers (8.7 miles) from Ajmer city and surrounded by the Aravalli Hills, Pushkar sits at an elevation of roughly 510 meters (1,673 feet) above sea level. It&amp;rsquo;s a prominent destination on the Hindu pilgrimage circuit and attracts both domestic and international tourists with its serene beauty and vibrant atmosphere. The lake itself is considered holy by Hindus, and its shores are lined with numerous temples and ghats (steps leading down to the water). Pushkar is particularly known for its annual Pushkar Camel Fair, one of the world&amp;rsquo;s largest camel fairs, transforming the landscape into a bustling hub of commerce, culture, and celebration.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
