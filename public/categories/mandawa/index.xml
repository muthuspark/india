      <description>&lt;h3 id=&#34;introduction&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Introduction&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Mandawa, a charming town nestled in the heart of the Shekhawati region of Rajasthan, India, is often referred to as the &amp;ldquo;Open Art Gallery&amp;rdquo; of Rajasthan. Located approximately 170 kilometers (105 miles) from Jaipur, it sits at an elevation of around 300 meters (980 feet) above sea level. Mandawaâ€™s allure lies in its beautifully preserved havelis (mansions) adorned with intricate frescoes, depicting mythological tales, royal processions, and scenes from everyday life. These stunning architectural marvels offer a glimpse into the rich history and cultural heritage of the Marwari merchants who once thrived in this region. Its unique charm lies in its ability to transport visitors back in time, offering an authentic experience of the royal Rajasthani lifestyle.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
