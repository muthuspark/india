&lt;p&gt;Abhaneri, a small village nestled in the Dausa district of Rajasthan, India, is an unlikely treasure trove of architectural and historical wonder. It is particularly renowned for the Chand Baori, one of the oldest and largest stepwells in India. Located approximately 95 kilometers from Jaipur and 33 kilometers from Dausa, Abhaneri sits at an elevation of around 300 meters above sea level. Its proximity to Jaipur makes it a popular day trip destination for those exploring the &amp;ldquo;Pink City.&amp;rdquo; What makes Abhaneri truly unique is the Chand Baori&amp;rsquo;s breathtaking design, its intricate interplay of light and shadow, and its testimony to the ingenuity of ancient Indian engineering.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
