Nestled between the Godavari River and the Bay of Bengal, this picturesque area is often referred to as the &amp;ldquo;Rice Bowl of Andhra Pradesh&amp;rdquo; due to its fertile lands. Situated approximately 50 kilometers from Kakinada, the district headquarters, Konaseema is an enchanting destination renowned for its lush green landscapes, serene backwaters, and vibrant cultural traditions. The region&amp;rsquo;s elevation is relatively low, mostly consisting of flat plains and river deltas.
