      <description>&lt;h3 id=&#34;introduction&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Introduction&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Dzongu, a serene and protected region in North Sikkim, India, is a hidden gem nestled within the breathtaking Himalayan landscape. Situated in the Mangan sub-division of North Sikkim, it&amp;rsquo;s a haven of natural beauty and cultural richness.  Located at an altitude ranging from approximately 1,500 meters to 4,000 meters, it offers stunning views of the snow-capped Kanchenjunga range. Dzongu&amp;rsquo;s unique distinction lies in being a reserved area for the indigenous Lepcha community, making it a place where their traditions and culture thrive, untouched by the overwhelming influence of the outside world. It&amp;rsquo;s a world away from the more crowded tourist spots, promising an experience of authentic Sikkimese culture and unspoiled natural beauty. It lies in close proximity to the popular destinations of Lachen and Lachung, serving as an ideal starting or ending point for exploring North Sikkim.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
