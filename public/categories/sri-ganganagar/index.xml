      <description>&lt;h3 id=&#34;introduction&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Introduction&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Kalibangan, a fascinating archaeological site located in the Hanumangarh district of Rajasthan, India, whispers tales of a vibrant, pre-historic civilization. Situated on the banks of the now-dry Ghaggar River (identified by some scholars as the ancient Saraswati River), Kalibangan offers a window into the Indus Valley Civilization, also known as the Harappan Civilization. Its strategic location, once fertile and conducive to agriculture, contributed to its early prosperity and significance. While the precise elevation of Kalibangan is difficult to ascertain, it lies within the vast plains of the northern Rajasthan desert. Its location within Sri Ganganagar places it roughly 350 km north of Jaipur, the state capital, and is relatively accessible from other historical and cultural centers in Rajasthan. What makes Kalibangan unique is its remarkably well-preserved archaeological remains, providing invaluable insights into the urban planning, lifestyle, and religious practices of the Indus Valley Civilization.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
