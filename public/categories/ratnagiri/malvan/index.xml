      <description>&lt;h3 id=&#34;introduction&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Introduction&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Velas Beach, nestled on the Konkan coast of Maharashtra, India, is a serene coastal paradise, primarily known for its annual Turtle Festival. Located approximately 200 kilometers south of Mumbai, Velas belongs to the Mandangad Taluka of Ratnagiri district, offering a tranquil escape from the hustle and bustle of city life. It sits at an elevation of roughly 5 meters (16 feet) above sea level. While closer to Ratnagiri, the area shares some cultural similarities with Malvan, another popular Konkan destination known for its seafood and beaches. What truly distinguishes Velas is its remarkable commitment to the conservation of Olive Ridley sea turtles, making it a unique destination for nature lovers, conservationists, and those seeking a peaceful getaway. The Turtle Festival, the heart of Velas&amp;rsquo; charm, provides a rare opportunity to witness the marvel of nature as hundreds of baby turtles make their journey to the sea.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
