&lt;p&gt;Banavasi, a historically rich town nestled in the Uttara Kannada district of Karnataka, India, is a treasure trove of ancient history and cultural heritage. Located approximately 395 kilometers from Bangalore, Banavasi is situated in the heart of the Malnad region, known for its lush greenery and fertile land. The town sits at an elevation of around 560 meters (1840 feet) above sea level, and is positioned near the Varada River. This makes it a scenic location. The town’s proximity to other popular destinations such as Jog Falls and the coastal regions of Karnataka makes it an ideal place to explore.
