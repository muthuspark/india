      <description>&lt;h3 id=&#34;introduction&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Introduction&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Dawki, a charming town nestled in the West Jaintia Hills district of Meghalaya, India, is renowned for its breathtaking natural beauty and the crystal-clear waters of the Umngot River. Located approximately 82 kilometers (51 miles) south of Shillong, the state&amp;rsquo;s capital, Dawki sits close to the India-Bangladesh border. It&amp;rsquo;s situated at an elevation of around 300 meters (984 feet) above sea level. The town’s primary allure is the Umngot River, often called the cleanest river in India, where you can see the riverbed through the transparent water. This unique characteristic, combined with its serene surroundings and vibrant local culture, makes Dawki a must-visit destination. It is often a stopover point for those travelling to Cherrapunjee (Sohra) and other parts of Meghalaya.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
