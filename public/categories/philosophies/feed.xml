&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Introduction&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Advaita Vedānta, meaning &amp;ldquo;non-duality&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;non-difference,&amp;rdquo; is one of the most influential schools of Vedānta, a sub-school within the broader Hindu philosophical tradition. It posits the ultimate reality as Brahman, the attributeless (nirguna) and undifferentiated absolute, and asserts the illusory nature of the phenomenal world (māyā). Advaita emphasizes the fundamental oneness of Atman (the individual self) with Brahman, advocating for liberation (moksha) through the realization of this identity. Its historical significance lies in its profound impact on Hindu thought, practice, and the development of Indian intellectual history. Its relevance continues today through its influence on contemporary spirituality and its ongoing engagement with modern philosophical concerns.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Ājīvika – School of Determinism and Fatalism</title><link>https://india.muthu.co/posts/philosophies/jvika--school-of-determinism-and-fatalism/</link><pubDate>Sun, 01 Dec 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://india.muthu.co/posts/philosophies/jvika--school-of-determinism-and-fatalism/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="ājīvika-the-indian-school-of-determinism-and-fatalism"&gt;Ājīvika: The Indian School of Determinism and Fatalism&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="introduction"&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ājīvika (Sanskrit: आजीविक) was an ancient Indian school of philosophy that flourished from the 6th century BCE to the 14th century CE. Characterized by its doctrine of strict determinism and fatalism, Ājīvika posited that all events are predetermined and governed by &lt;em&gt;Niyati&lt;/em&gt; (destiny or fate), leaving no room for free will or human agency. This deterministic worldview permeated its metaphysical, ethical, and soteriological teachings. While Ājīvika eventually disappeared as a distinct organized tradition, its influence on subsequent Indian thought, particularly its challenges to the doctrines of karma and rebirth, remains significant. Historically, the Ājīvikas represented a heterodox (nāstika) challenge to the emerging orthodox (āstika) traditions of Hinduism and the established Sramana traditions like Jainism and Buddhism.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Bhedābheda – School of Difference and Non-Difference</title><link>https://india.muthu.co/posts/philosophies/bhedbheda--school-of-difference-and-non-difference/</link><pubDate>Sun, 01 Dec 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://india.muthu.co/posts/philosophies/bhedbheda--school-of-difference-and-non-difference/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="bhedābheda-the-philosophy-of-difference-and-non-difference"&gt;Bhedābheda: The Philosophy of Difference and Non-Difference&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Introduction&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bhedābheda (भेदभेद) is a school of Vedanta philosophy within Hinduism that attempts to reconcile the apparently contradictory notions of difference (bheda) and non-difference (abheda) between the individual self (ātman) and the ultimate reality, Brahman. Instead of subscribing solely to a radical monism (non-dualism) or a strict dualism, Bhedābheda posits that the relationship is simultaneously one of identity and distinction. This nuanced perspective seeks to explain how the multiplicity of the world can arise from and exist within a singular, unified reality. The Bhedābheda perspective has been a significant thread within the tapestry of Indian philosophical thought, influencing various devotional movements and offering a unique lens through which to understand the nature of existence, self, and liberation.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Buddhism – School of Middle Way and Non-Self</title><link>https://india.muthu.co/posts/philosophies/buddhism--school-of-middle-way-and-non-self/</link><pubDate>Sun, 01 Dec 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://india.muthu.co/posts/philosophies/buddhism--school-of-middle-way-and-non-self/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="the-middle-way-and-non-self-an-exploration-of-buddhist-philosophy"&gt;The Middle Way and Non-Self: An Exploration of Buddhist Philosophy&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="introduction"&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Buddhist philosophical tradition, originating in ancient India, offers a complex and nuanced understanding of reality, suffering, and liberation. Central to many schools of Buddhist thought are the concepts of the &amp;ldquo;Middle Way&amp;rdquo; (Madhyamaka) and the doctrine of &amp;ldquo;Non-Self&amp;rdquo; (Anatta). The Middle Way rejects extreme views and advocates for a balanced approach to understanding the nature of reality, while the concept of Non-Self challenges conventional notions of a permanent, independent self or soul. These concepts, interconnected and mutually reinforcing, form the foundation of a philosophy aimed at alleviating suffering and attaining enlightenment (Nirvana). This article will explore the historical development, core doctrines, ethical teachings, and enduring influence of this significant branch of Indian Buddhist thought.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Cārvāka/Lokāyata – School of Materialism and Empiricism</title><link>https://india.muthu.co/posts/philosophies/crvkalokyata--school-of-materialism-and-empiricism/</link><pubDate>Sun, 01 Dec 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://india.muthu.co/posts/philosophies/crvkalokyata--school-of-materialism-and-empiricism/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="cārvākalokāyata-a-school-of-materialism-and-empiricism-in-indian-philosophy"&gt;Cārvāka/Lokāyata: A School of Materialism and Empiricism in Indian Philosophy&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Introduction&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cārvāka, also known as Lokāyata, represents a prominent school of Indian philosophy characterized by its materialism, empiricism, and skepticism. It stands out as a heterodox (nāstika) school, rejecting the authority of the Vedas, the concept of an afterlife, and many commonly held religious beliefs within the Indian context. Cārvāka emphasizes direct perception (pratyakṣa) as the sole valid source of knowledge and advocates for a hedonistic pursuit of pleasure within the boundaries of earthly existence. While often dismissed or caricatured by its detractors, Cārvāka&amp;rsquo;s articulation of materialistic principles and its critique of metaphysical speculation have played a significant role in the intellectual landscape of ancient and medieval India.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Dvaita – School of Dualism</title><link>https://india.muthu.co/posts/philosophies/dvaita--school-of-dualism/</link><pubDate>Sun, 01 Dec 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://india.muthu.co/posts/philosophies/dvaita--school-of-dualism/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="dvaita-vedanta-the-school-of-dualism"&gt;Dvaita Vedanta: The School of Dualism&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="introduction"&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dvaita Vedanta, meaning &amp;ldquo;dualistic Vedanta,&amp;rdquo; is one of the major schools of Vedanta, a prominent tradition within Hindu philosophy. Founded by Madhvacharya in the 13th century, it stands in stark contrast to the non-dualistic (Advaita) Vedanta of Shankaracharya and the qualified non-dualistic (Vishishtadvaita) Vedanta of Ramanujacharya. Dvaita posits a permanent and fundamental distinction between Brahman (the ultimate reality) and the individual souls (jivas), maintaining that they are eternally separate and distinct entities. This philosophy emphasizes the supreme independence of God, identified with Vishnu, and the dependence of all other beings on Him. Dvaita&amp;rsquo;s significance lies in its articulation of a deeply theistic perspective within Vedanta, offering a systematic framework for understanding God as a personal and actively involved creator, preserver, and destroyer of the universe. It has significantly influenced devotional practices and philosophical thought across India for centuries.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Jainism – School of Non-Violence and Non-Absolutism</title><link>https://india.muthu.co/posts/philosophies/jainism--school-of-non-violence-and-non-absolutism/</link><pubDate>Sun, 01 Dec 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://india.muthu.co/posts/philosophies/jainism--school-of-non-violence-and-non-absolutism/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="jainism-the-philosophy-of-non-violence-and-non-absolutism"&gt;Jainism: The Philosophy of Non-Violence and Non-Absolutism&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="introduction"&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jainism, an ancient Indian religion and philosophy, is primarily known for its rigorous commitment to &lt;em&gt;ahimsa&lt;/em&gt; (non-violence) and its unique doctrine of &lt;em&gt;anekantavada&lt;/em&gt; (non-absolutism). Beyond its ethical emphasis, Jainism offers a comprehensive worldview encompassing metaphysics, epistemology, and soteriology. It proposes a path to liberation (moksha) through self-discipline, austerity, and the eradication of karma. Jainism has significantly impacted Indian society, influencing ethical thought, art, literature, and even political movements. Its enduring relevance lies in its promotion of peace, environmental responsibility, and ethical living.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Kashmir Shaivism – School of Non-Dual Shaivism</title><link>https://india.muthu.co/posts/philosophies/kashmir-shaivism--school-of-non-dual-shaivism/</link><pubDate>Sun, 01 Dec 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://india.muthu.co/posts/philosophies/kashmir-shaivism--school-of-non-dual-shaivism/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="kashmir-shaivism-a-monistic-school-of-hindu-philosophy"&gt;Kashmir Shaivism: A Monistic School of Hindu Philosophy&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="introduction"&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kashmir Shaivism, also known as Trika Shaivism (referring to its emphasis on the triad of Shiva, Shakti, and Nara - the divine, energy, and individual), is a non-dualist (Advaita) school of Shaivism that originated in Kashmir sometime around the 9th century CE. It posits a unified reality where Shiva, the supreme consciousness, is the only reality. Unlike other forms of Shaivism that emphasize devotion and ritual, Kashmir Shaivism prioritizes direct experience (anubhava) and recognition (pratyabhijna) of one&amp;rsquo;s inherent Shiva-nature. This school provides a sophisticated philosophical framework to understand the relationship between the individual, the universe, and the divine. Its historical significance lies in its unique interpretation of Advaita Vedanta, incorporating tantric elements and a radical affirmation of the world as an expression of divine consciousness. Today, despite its historical decline in Kashmir itself, the philosophy continues to be studied and practiced by adherents worldwide, influencing both religious and philosophical discourse.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Mīmāṃsā – School of Vedic Exegesis and Ritual</title><link>https://india.muthu.co/posts/philosophies/mms--school-of-vedic-exegesis-and-ritual/</link><pubDate>Sun, 01 Dec 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://india.muthu.co/posts/philosophies/mms--school-of-vedic-exegesis-and-ritual/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="mīmāṃsā-school-of-vedic-exegesis-and-ritual"&gt;Mīmāṃsā: School of Vedic Exegesis and Ritual&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Introduction&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mīmāṃsā, often translated as “reflection,” “investigation,” or “interpretation,” is one of the six classical (astika) schools of Hindu philosophy (the others being Nyaya, Vaisheshika, Samkhya, Yoga, and Vedanta). Its primary focus is the interpretation of the Vedas, especially the portion dealing with ritual actions (the Karma-kanda). Mīmāṃsā argues that the Vedas are eternal and self-valid, and that the proper understanding of Vedic texts is crucial for attaining dharma (righteous conduct) and achieving desirable results. It holds a unique position by prioritizing the performance of Vedic rituals as the primary path to liberation, diverging from other schools that emphasize knowledge or devotion. Historically significant, Mīmāṃsā shaped the understanding of Vedic authority and profoundly influenced legal and ethical thought within Hinduism.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Nyāya – School of Logic and Epistemology</title><link>https://india.muthu.co/posts/philosophies/nyya--school-of-logic-and-epistemology/</link><pubDate>Sun, 01 Dec 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://india.muthu.co/posts/philosophies/nyya--school-of-logic-and-epistemology/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="nyāya-the-indian-school-of-logic-and-epistemology"&gt;Nyāya: The Indian School of Logic and Epistemology&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Introduction&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nyāya (Sanskrit: न्याय, meaning &amp;ldquo;justice,&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;rules,&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;method,&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;judgment&amp;rdquo;) is one of the six classical schools (darśanas) of Indian philosophy, specifically focusing on epistemology (the study of knowledge) and logic. It is deeply concerned with the means of attaining valid knowledge (pramāṇa) and the structure of arguments. Nyāya provides a systematic framework for analyzing the validity of claims and is known for its rigorous and analytical approach to understanding reality. While primarily a school of epistemology, Nyāya also presents a distinct metaphysics and soteriology (doctrine of salvation) integrated with its logical framework. Its enduring significance lies in its contribution to rational inquiry and its influence on the development of philosophical thought within India and beyond.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Śākta – School of Divine Feminine Power</title><link>https://india.muthu.co/posts/philosophies/kta--school-of-divine-feminine-power/</link><pubDate>Sun, 01 Dec 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://india.muthu.co/posts/philosophies/kta--school-of-divine-feminine-power/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="śākta-school-of-divine-feminine-power"&gt;Śākta: School of Divine Feminine Power&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Introduction&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Śākta (Sanskrit: शाक्त, lit. &amp;ldquo;power&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;energy&amp;rdquo;) is a Hindu denomination and philosophical system that centers on the worship of Śakti, the Divine Feminine, understood as the ultimate reality and the dynamic force behind the universe. It posits that Śakti, personified in various goddesses, is the source of all creation, preservation, and destruction. Śākta philosophy provides a comprehensive framework for understanding existence, encompassing metaphysics, ethics, and ritual practices aimed at realizing union with the Divine Feminine. Śākta represents a significant strand within Hinduism, impacting various aspects of Indian culture and continuing to be practiced today.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Sāṃkhya – School of Enumeration and Dualism</title><link>https://india.muthu.co/posts/philosophies/skhya--school-of-enumeration-and-dualism/</link><pubDate>Sun, 01 Dec 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://india.muthu.co/posts/philosophies/skhya--school-of-enumeration-and-dualism/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="sāṃkhya-the-school-of-enumeration-and-dualism"&gt;Sāṃkhya: The School of Enumeration and Dualism&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Introduction&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sāṃkhya, often translated as &amp;ldquo;enumeration&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;calculation,&amp;rdquo; is one of the oldest schools of Indian philosophy, classified as one of the six &lt;em&gt;Astika&lt;/em&gt; (orthodox) schools of Hindu philosophy. It is characterized by its dualistic metaphysics, positing two distinct and independent realities: &lt;em&gt;Prakriti&lt;/em&gt; (primordial nature) and &lt;em&gt;Purusha&lt;/em&gt; (pure consciousness). Sāṃkhya aims to provide a rational explanation of the universe and the human condition, ultimately leading to &lt;em&gt;Kaivalya&lt;/em&gt; (liberation), a state of absolute isolation and freedom from suffering. Its influence has been profound, shaping various aspects of Indian thought, including Yoga, Vedanta, and even aspects of Buddhism and Jainism.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Shaiva Siddhānta – School of Theistic Shaivism</title><link>https://india.muthu.co/posts/philosophies/shaiva-siddhnta--school-of-theistic-shaivism/</link><pubDate>Sun, 01 Dec 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://india.muthu.co/posts/philosophies/shaiva-siddhnta--school-of-theistic-shaivism/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="shaiva-siddhānta-a-school-of-theistic-shaivism"&gt;Shaiva Siddhānta: A School of Theistic Shaivism&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="introduction"&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shaiva Siddhānta, meaning &amp;ldquo;the established doctrine of Shiva,&amp;rdquo; is a prominent and influential school of Theistic Shaivism within Hinduism. It presents a comprehensive philosophical and religious system centered around the worship of Shiva as the supreme deity, the ultimate reality, and the efficient and material cause of the universe. Unlike other Shaiva traditions that might emphasize asceticism or non-dualistic interpretations, Shaiva Siddhānta emphasizes devotion (bhakti) to Shiva alongside ritual practice and philosophical understanding as pathways to liberation (moksha). This school played a significant role in shaping South Indian culture, particularly in Tamil Nadu, and continues to be practiced and studied today.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Sikh Philosophy – School of Divine Unity and Social Justice</title><link>https://india.muthu.co/posts/philosophies/sikh-philosophy--school-of-divine-unity-and-social-justice/</link><pubDate>Sun, 01 Dec 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://india.muthu.co/posts/philosophies/sikh-philosophy--school-of-divine-unity-and-social-justice/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="sikh-philosophy-school-of-divine-unity-and-social-justice"&gt;Sikh Philosophy: School of Divine Unity and Social Justice&lt;/h2&gt;

It is characterized by its belief in one supreme being, its emphasis on truthful living, righteous action, service to humanity, and its rejection of empty rituals and caste distinctions. Rooted in the teachings of Guru Nanak Dev Ji and further developed by the nine successive Gurus, Sikh philosophy provides a comprehensive worldview encompassing metaphysical, ethical, and social dimensions, emphasizing a life lived in harmony with God and dedicated to the betterment of society. Its historical significance lies in its challenge to the prevailing socio-political structures of the time, advocating for equality, justice, and religious freedom. Today, Sikh philosophy continues to inspire millions globally, informing their spiritual practices and guiding their engagement with the world.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Śūnyavāda – School of Emptiness</title><link>https://india.muthu.co/posts/philosophies/nyavda--school-of-emptiness/</link><pubDate>Sun, 01 Dec 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://india.muthu.co/posts/philosophies/nyavda--school-of-emptiness/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="śūnyavāda-the-buddhist-school-of-emptiness"&gt;Śūnyavāda: The Buddhist School of Emptiness&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="introduction"&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Śūnyavāda, often translated as the &amp;ldquo;Doctrine of Emptiness,&amp;rdquo; is a major school of Buddhist philosophy within the Mahāyāna tradition. It centers around the concept of &lt;em&gt;śūnyatā&lt;/em&gt; (emptiness or voidness), arguing that all phenomena are devoid of inherent existence, essence, or self-nature. This does not imply nihilism but rather points to the interdependence and impermanence of all things. Śūnyavāda offers a profound understanding of reality, challenging conventional notions of self and substance, and providing a path towards liberation from suffering. The philosophy has had a lasting impact on Buddhist thought and practice, influencing art, literature, and ethics across various cultures.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Tāntrika – School of Esoteric Practices</title><link>https://india.muthu.co/posts/philosophies/tntrika--school-of-esoteric-practices/</link><pubDate>Sun, 01 Dec 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://india.muthu.co/posts/philosophies/tntrika--school-of-esoteric-practices/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="tāntrika-school-of-esoteric-practices-in-indian-philosophy"&gt;Tāntrika: School of Esoteric Practices in Indian Philosophy&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="introduction"&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tāntrika, often referred to as Tantra, is a diverse and influential school of esoteric traditions within Hinduism, Buddhism, and Jainism. Originating in India, Tāntrika encompasses a wide range of practices, beliefs, and philosophical systems centered around the idea of utilizing ritual, symbolism, and direct experience to accelerate spiritual evolution and achieve liberation (moksha). Contrary to popular misconceptions, Tantra is not solely focused on sexuality; rather, it aims to harness all aspects of existence, including the body, senses, and emotions, as pathways to self-realization. Historically significant, Tāntrika has significantly shaped religious practices, art, literature, and social structures across South Asia and beyond. Its relevance endures today, with practitioners worldwide exploring its methods for personal and spiritual growth.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Vaisheshika – School of Atomism and Naturalism</title><link>https://india.muthu.co/posts/philosophies/vaisheshika--school-of-atomism-and-naturalism/</link><pubDate>Sun, 01 Dec 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://india.muthu.co/posts/philosophies/vaisheshika--school-of-atomism-and-naturalism/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="vaisheshika-the-indian-school-of-atomism-and-naturalism"&gt;Vaisheshika: The Indian School of Atomism and Naturalism&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Introduction&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vaisheshika is one of the six classical schools (darshanas) of Indian philosophy, alongside Nyaya, Samkhya, Yoga, Mimamsa, and Vedanta. It is closely linked to Nyaya, sharing methodological and ontological concerns, often studied as a combined system. While Nyaya emphasizes epistemology and logic, Vaisheshika focuses on metaphysics and natural philosophy, particularly the analysis of reality into fundamental categories and the atomic constitution of the universe. Vaisheshika is particularly significant for its atomic theory, positing that the universe is composed of indivisible and eternal atoms, making it a pioneering school of atomism in ancient philosophy. Its relevance lies in its early attempt to understand the material world through observation, categorization, and logical reasoning, laying the groundwork for scientific inquiry within the Indian intellectual landscape.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Vaishnava – School of Devotion to Vishnu</title><link>https://india.muthu.co/posts/philosophies/vaishnava--school-of-devotion-to-vishnu/</link><pubDate>Sun, 01 Dec 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://india.muthu.co/posts/philosophies/vaishnava--school-of-devotion-to-vishnu/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="vaishnava-the-school-of-devotion-to-vishnu"&gt;Vaishnava: The School of Devotion to Vishnu&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="introduction"&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vaishnava, also known as Vishnuism, is a major tradition within Hinduism characterized by its primary devotion to Vishnu as the Supreme Being. It encompasses a diverse range of theological and philosophical schools that center on the worship and understanding of Vishnu and his various avatars (incarnations), such as Rama and Krishna. Vaishnavism emphasizes the path of bhakti (devotion) as the principal means of attaining moksha (liberation) from the cycle of birth and death. Its historical significance lies in its profound influence on Indian society, culture, art, literature, and philosophy, shaping devotional practices and ethical frameworks for centuries. This article aims to provide a comprehensive overview of Vaishnava philosophy, its historical development, core doctrines, ethical teachings, major schools, influence, and ongoing debates.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Vedānta – School of Ultimate Reality and Spiritual Knowledge</title><link>https://india.muthu.co/posts/philosophies/vednta--school-of-ultimate-reality-and-spiritual-knowledge/</link><pubDate>Sun, 01 Dec 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://india.muthu.co/posts/philosophies/vednta--school-of-ultimate-reality-and-spiritual-knowledge/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="vedānta-school-of-ultimate-reality-and-spiritual-knowledge"&gt;Vedānta: School of Ultimate Reality and Spiritual Knowledge&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Introduction&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vedānta, meaning &amp;ldquo;the end of the Vedas,&amp;rdquo; is one of the most influential and profound schools of thought within Indian philosophy. It represents the culmination of Vedic wisdom, focusing on the nature of reality (Brahman), the true self (Atman), and the relationship between the two. Aiming towards liberation (moksha) from the cycle of birth and death (samsara), Vedānta provides a framework for understanding the universe and achieving spiritual enlightenment. Its historical significance lies in its systematic interpretation of the Upanishads, which form the core of its philosophical foundation. Vedānta&amp;rsquo;s enduring relevance is evident in its continued influence on Indian culture, spirituality, and its growing appeal to individuals seeking meaning and self-understanding worldwide.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Vishishtadvaita – School of Qualified Non-Dualism</title><link>https://india.muthu.co/posts/philosophies/vishishtadvaita--school-of-qualified-non-dualism/</link><pubDate>Sun, 01 Dec 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://india.muthu.co/posts/philosophies/vishishtadvaita--school-of-qualified-non-dualism/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="vishishtadvaita-school-of-qualified-non-dualism"&gt;Vishishtadvaita: School of Qualified Non-Dualism&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Introduction&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vishishtadvaita, meaning &amp;ldquo;qualified non-dualism,&amp;rdquo; is a prominent school of Vedanta philosophy within Hinduism. It posits a non-dualistic (Advaita) reality where Brahman (the ultimate reality) is the sole existence, but qualifies this non-duality by asserting that Brahman is not devoid of attributes (Saguna Brahman). Instead, Brahman possesses qualities and is differentiated internally through the existence of souls (jivas) and matter (prakriti), which are eternally distinct yet inseparable aspects of Brahman. Vishishtadvaita offers a unique perspective on the relationship between the individual self and the ultimate reality, emphasizing devotion (bhakti) as a primary means to liberation (moksha). Historically, it has been a significant force in shaping religious practices, philosophical thought, and social structures in India, particularly in South India.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Yoga – School of Physical and Mental Discipline</title><link>https://india.muthu.co/posts/philosophies/yoga--school-of-physical-and-mental-discipline/</link><pubDate>Sun, 01 Dec 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://india.muthu.co/posts/philosophies/yoga--school-of-physical-and-mental-discipline/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="yoga-school-of-physical-and-mental-discipline-in-indian-philosophy"&gt;Yoga: School of Physical and Mental Discipline in Indian Philosophy&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="introduction"&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yoga, in the context of Indian philosophy, is one of the six orthodox (Astika) schools of Hindu philosophy. More than just physical postures, commonly associated with it in the West, Yoga is a comprehensive system of physical, mental, and spiritual discipline aiming at self-realization and liberation (moksha) from the cycle of birth and death. The Yoga school emphasizes the practical application of philosophical principles to attain a state of union with the ultimate reality. While sharing metaphysical and epistemological foundations with Samkhya philosophy, Yoga focuses on the techniques and methods needed to achieve the separation of Purusha (pure consciousness) from Prakriti (matter), ultimately leading to liberation. Yoga&amp;rsquo;s historical significance lies in its enduring influence on Indian culture, religion, and medicine, as well as its increasing global popularity as a practice promoting well-being.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Yogācāra – School of Consciousness-Only</title><link>https://india.muthu.co/posts/philosophies/yogcra--school-of-consciousness-only/</link><pubDate>Sun, 01 Dec 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://india.muthu.co/posts/philosophies/yogcra--school-of-consciousness-only/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="yogācāra-the-consciousness-only-school-of-buddhist-philosophy"&gt;Yogācāra: The Consciousness-Only School of Buddhist Philosophy&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="introduction"&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yogācāra, also known as Vijñānavāda (&amp;ldquo;doctrine of consciousness&amp;rdquo;), is a major school of Buddhist philosophy that emerged within the Mahāyāna tradition. It emphasizes the role of consciousness ( &lt;em&gt;vijñāna&lt;/em&gt;) in shaping our perception of reality. Instead of positing an external world independent of the mind, Yogācāra asserts that experience is fundamentally mental, arising from and within consciousness. This &amp;ldquo;consciousness-only&amp;rdquo; ( &lt;em&gt;cittamātra&lt;/em&gt;) view seeks to address the nature of reality, the self, and the path to liberation through introspective analysis of mental phenomena. The school holds significant historical relevance, shaping the development of Buddhist thought and influencing other philosophical and religious traditions.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
