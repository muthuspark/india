      <description>&lt;h3 id=&#34;introduction&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Introduction&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Vaishno Devi, also known as Mata Vaishno Devi, is one of the most revered Hindu pilgrimage sites in India. Located in the Trikuta Mountains within the Katra region of Jammu and Kashmir, it is nestled at an elevation of approximately 5,200 feet (1,585 meters) above sea level. Katra itself is approximately 48 kilometers (30 miles) from Jammu, the nearest major city and transportation hub. The shrine is a cave temple dedicated to the goddess Vaishnavi, an incarnation of the Hindu goddess Durga. The arduous but spiritually rewarding trek to the temple, combined with the surrounding breathtaking natural beauty, makes Vaishno Devi a uniquely compelling destination for millions of devotees and tourists annually.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
