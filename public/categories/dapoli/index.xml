Situated approximately 215 kilometers south of Mumbai, Dapoli, often referred to as &amp;ldquo;Mini Mahabaleshwar&amp;rdquo; due to its cool climate, sits at an elevation of around 800 feet above sea level. The town provides a perfect escape from the hustle and bustle of city life, offering a blend of natural beauty, historical significance, and a relaxed pace of life. Its proximity to popular tourist destinations like Mumbai, Pune and Goa makes it an accessible yet secluded haven.
