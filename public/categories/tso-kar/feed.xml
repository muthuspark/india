&lt;p&gt;Tso Kar Lake, also known as the &amp;ldquo;White Lake&amp;rdquo; due to the salt efflorescence on its shores, is a high-altitude wetland located in the Changthang region of Ladakh, India. Situated within the Rupshu Plateau and valley, at an elevation of approximately 4,530 meters (14,860 feet) above sea level, Tso Kar offers a unique and surreal landscape characterized by its vast expanse, shimmering waters, and the stark beauty of the surrounding mountains. It is a less-visited gem compared to its more famous Ladakhi counterparts like Pangong Tso and Tso Moriri, providing a tranquil escape for nature enthusiasts and adventure seekers. The lake is approximately 17 kilometers (11 miles) in length and 5 kilometers (3 miles) in width at its widest points, offering a dramatic panorama. It lies close to the Leh-Manali Highway, and it is also a significant stop for those exploring the Ladakh region.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
