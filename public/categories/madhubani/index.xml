      <description>&lt;h3 id=&#34;introduction&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Introduction&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Madhubani, a vibrant district in the heart of Bihar, India, is a place steeped in rich cultural heritage and renowned for its globally celebrated art form. Situated in the Mithila region, Madhubani is approximately 125 kilometers (78 miles) northeast of Patna, the state capital. The district lies at an elevation of around 55 meters (180 feet) above sea level, and is close to the border of Nepal, influencing its cultural landscape. Madhubani stands out due to its captivating artistic traditions, particularly Madhubani painting (also known as Mithila painting), a style passed down through generations of women in the region. This art form, combined with its historical significance and the warmth of its people, makes Madhubani a compelling destination for cultural explorers and art enthusiasts.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
