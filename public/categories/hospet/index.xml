Situated amidst a surreal landscape of colossal boulders and ancient ruins, Hampi is a testament to the grandeur of the Vijayanagara Empire (14th-17th centuries). Its elevation is approximately 467 meters (1,532 feet) above sea level. Hampi&amp;rsquo;s proximity to Hospet (approximately 13 km away) makes it easily accessible for travelers. What makes Hampi truly unique is the harmonious blend of its architectural marvels, its spiritual significance, and its stark, dramatic natural beauty. It&amp;rsquo;s a place where history whispers from every stone, inviting visitors to step back in time and experience a bygone era.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
