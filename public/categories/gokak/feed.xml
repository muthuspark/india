&lt;p&gt;Gokak Falls, a picturesque waterfall cascading down a rocky gorge, is a mesmerizing natural wonder located in Gokak, Karnataka, India. This stunning cascade is formed by the Ghataprabha River, which plunges over a sandstone cliff, creating a spectacle of roaring water and misty spray. Situated within the Belgaum district, Gokak Falls is a popular destination for tourists seeking both natural beauty and a tranquil escape. The falls are nestled in a region known for its rich agricultural lands, historical significance, and vibrant cultural traditions. The location offers an enchanting spectacle, especially during the monsoon season when the river swells with fresh water, making it a truly unforgettable experience. It is located approximately 68 kilometers (42 miles) from Belgaum City.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
