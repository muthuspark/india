&lt;p&gt;Sonamarg, meaning &amp;ldquo;Meadow of Gold,&amp;rdquo; is a breathtakingly beautiful hill station in the Ganderbal district of the Indian union territory of Jammu and Kashmir. Situated at an altitude of approximately 2,800 meters (9,200 feet) above sea level, Sonamarg is a key point of the Zoji La pass and is nestled amidst the majestic Himalayan ranges. Its location, about 80 kilometers northeast of Srinagar, makes it easily accessible while still retaining its serene and untouched charm. The landscape is dominated by snow-capped mountains, lush green meadows, and the Sindh River, creating a stunning panorama that attracts tourists and adventure seekers alike. This area is particularly famous for its scenic beauty, trekking trails, and as a base for exploring the high-altitude passes of the region.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
