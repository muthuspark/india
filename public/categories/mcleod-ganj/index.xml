      <description>&lt;h3 id=&#34;introduction&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Introduction&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;McLeod Ganj, often referred to as &amp;ldquo;Little Lhasa&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;Dharamsala Upper,&amp;rdquo; is a mesmerizing hill station situated in the Kangra district of Himachal Pradesh, India. Nestled in the Dhauladhar range of the Himalayas, it sits at an elevation of approximately 2,082 meters (6,831 feet). This vibrant town is renowned not only for its stunning natural beauty but also for being the seat of the 14th Dalai Lama and the Tibetan government-in-exile. Its proximity to Dharamsala, only about 9 kilometers away, makes it an easily accessible and popular destination for travelers seeking a blend of spirituality, adventure, and cultural immersion. McLeod Ganj is unique for its strong Tibetan influence, evident in its monasteries, prayer flags, cuisine, and the palpable sense of peace and serenity that pervades the town.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
