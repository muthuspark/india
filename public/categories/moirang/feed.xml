      <description>&lt;h3 id=&#34;introduction&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Introduction&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Keibul Lamjao National Park, nestled in the Moirang district of Manipur, India, is a place of unparalleled beauty and ecological significance. Located approximately 50 km south of Imphal, the capital city of Manipur, this unique park is situated on the southeastern shore of Loktak Lake, the largest freshwater lake in Northeast India. The park&amp;rsquo;s elevation is relatively low, ranging from approximately 768 to 817 meters above sea level. Keibul Lamjao is renowned worldwide as the only floating national park in the world, a testament to its extraordinary ecosystem. This floating landscape, comprised of decomposed plants, soil, and organic matter called &amp;ldquo;phumdi,&amp;rdquo; supports a unique biodiversity and offers an experience unlike any other. The park&amp;rsquo;s heart is the preservation of the critically endangered Manipur brow-antlered deer (Sangai), a species found nowhere else in the world.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
