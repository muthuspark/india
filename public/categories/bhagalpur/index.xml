      <description>&lt;h3 id=&#34;introduction&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Introduction&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The Vikramshila Gangetic Dolphin Sanctuary, a precious haven for the endangered Gangetic river dolphin (Platanista gangetica gangetica), is located in the Bhagalpur district of Bihar, India. This sanctuary stretches along a 50-kilometer stretch of the Ganges River between Sultanganj and Kahalgaon. It&amp;rsquo;s a significant area due to its ecological importance and the critical role it plays in protecting one of the world&amp;rsquo;s rarest mammals. Situated in the heart of Bihar, it&amp;rsquo;s relatively easy to access and offers a unique wildlife experience coupled with the cultural richness of the region. The elevation is relatively low, reflecting the flat plains of the Gangetic basin. The nearest major city is Bhagalpur, a historically important trading center, which serves as a gateway to the sanctuary. The sanctuary provides a rare opportunity to observe these elusive creatures in their natural habitat and offers a glimpse into the fragile ecosystem of the Ganges.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
