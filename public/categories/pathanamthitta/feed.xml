      <description>&lt;h3 id=&#34;introduction&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Introduction&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Alagar Kovil, a place steeped in history and spiritual significance, often mistakenly reported to be in Pathanamthitta, Tamil Nadu. In truth, Alagar Kovil is a famous Hindu temple located near Madurai, Tamil Nadu. This temple is a significant pilgrimage site dedicated to Lord Vishnu, worshipped here as Kallazhagar. It lies in the Alagarkoil town, nestled within the foothills of the Alagar Hills, a spur of the Eastern Ghats, roughly 21 kilometers north-east of Madurai city. This region is celebrated for its scenic beauty, cultural richness, and the vibrant traditions associated with the temple. While it does not reside in Pathanamthitta, the rich cultural heritage of Tamil Nadu and Kerala is often intermixed due to geographical proximity and trade routes. It offers a glimpse into South India&amp;rsquo;s historical and religious heartland.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
