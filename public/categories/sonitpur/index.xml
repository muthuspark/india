      <description>&lt;h3 id=&#34;introduction&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Introduction&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Orang National Park, a verdant sanctuary nestled in the heart of Assam, India, is a biodiversity hotspot that captivates with its rich wildlife and stunning landscapes. Situated in the Sonitpur district, the park lies on the north bank of the Brahmaputra River, a short distance from the city of Tezpur. It boasts an elevation ranging from 50 to 80 meters above sea level. Orang National Park stands out for its relatively small size yet remarkable density of wildlife, offering visitors a microcosm of Assam&amp;rsquo;s natural heritage and a chance to witness the majestic Indian one-horned rhinoceros in its natural habitat. Its proximity to Kaziranga National Park adds to its appeal, often considered a &amp;ldquo;mini Kaziranga&amp;rdquo; due to its similar ecological characteristics.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
