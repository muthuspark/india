&lt;p&gt;The Konark Sun Temple, a UNESCO World Heritage site, stands as a majestic testament to India&amp;rsquo;s rich architectural and cultural heritage. Located in Konark, Odisha, it sits on the Bay of Bengal coast, approximately 35 kilometers (22 miles) northeast of Puri and 65 kilometers (40 miles) southeast of Bhubaneswar, the state capital. Situated on a low-lying coastal plain, its elevation is close to sea level. Its unique shape, intricate carvings, and historical significance draw visitors from around the globe. The temple, dedicated to the Sun God, Surya, is celebrated not only for its artistic brilliance but also for its sophisticated engineering, representing the culmination of Orissan temple architecture.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
