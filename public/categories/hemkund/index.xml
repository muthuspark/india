Situated at an astounding elevation of 4,632 meters (15,200 feet) above sea level, it is one of the highest gurudwaras in the world. Hemkund Sahib is nestled amidst the majestic Himalayan mountains, surrounded by snow-capped peaks and a pristine glacial lake known as Hemkund. The gurudwara holds immense spiritual significance for Sikhs and attracts thousands of devotees annually. Its remoteness and challenging trek make the journey a true pilgrimage, offering breathtaking scenery and a profound sense of peace and devotion.
