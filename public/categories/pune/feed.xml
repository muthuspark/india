&lt;p&gt;Matheran, a picturesque hill station in the Raigad district of Maharashtra, India, is a unique escape from the hustle and bustle of city life. Situated approximately 80 kilometers (50 miles) from Mumbai and 120 kilometers (75 miles) from Pune, Matheran is perched at an elevation of 800 meters (2,625 feet) above sea level. What truly distinguishes Matheran is its status as an &amp;ldquo;eco-sensitive region.&amp;rdquo; This means all motor vehicles are prohibited within the town limits, preserving its serene atmosphere and unspoiled natural beauty. This ban, enforced since the British colonial era, makes Matheran a truly unique destination where the only modes of transport are on foot, horseback, or the iconic toy train.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Rajgad Fort: A Majestic Symbol of Maharashtra's History</title><link>https://india.muthu.co/posts/places/maharashtra/rajgad-fort-a-majestic-symbol-of-maharashtras-history/</link><pubDate>Thu, 13 Mar 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://india.muthu.co/posts/places/maharashtra/rajgad-fort-a-majestic-symbol-of-maharashtras-history/</guid><description>&lt;h3 id="introduction"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Introduction&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
