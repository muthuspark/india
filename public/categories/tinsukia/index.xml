      <description>&lt;h3 id=&#34;introduction&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Introduction&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Parashuram Kund, a revered Hindu pilgrimage site, is located in the Lohit district of Arunachal Pradesh, India, though itâ€™s often mistakenly associated with Tinsukia district. Situated at an altitude of approximately 182 meters (597 feet) above sea level, the Kund is nestled amidst the lush, mountainous terrain of the lower Himalayas. The site is known for its stunning natural beauty, the spiritual significance of the kund (a natural reservoir of water), and the annual pilgrimage that attracts thousands of devotees. Its isolation and the challenging journey add to the aura of mystique that surrounds this sacred place. While technically not within Tinsukia district, its accessibility often routes through Tinsukia, making it a relevant starting point for many pilgrims.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
