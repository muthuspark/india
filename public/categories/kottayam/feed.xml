&lt;p&gt;Ponmudi, a picturesque hill station in Kerala, also known as the &amp;ldquo;Golden Peak,&amp;rdquo; is a verdant paradise nestled within the Western Ghats. While it&amp;rsquo;s not located in Kottayam, it is situated in the Thiruvananthapuram district. The region&amp;rsquo;s proximity to popular destinations in Kerala, such as Kovalam and Trivandrum, makes it an easily accessible escape from the coastal heat. Ponmudi&amp;rsquo;s charm lies in its rolling hills, lush tea plantations, and the ever-present mist that often shrouds the peaks, creating a magical and serene atmosphere. The elevation of Ponmudi is approximately 1,100 meters (3,600 ft) above sea level. This altitude ensures a perpetually pleasant climate, making it a perfect destination for nature lovers and those seeking respite from the hustle and bustle of city life.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
