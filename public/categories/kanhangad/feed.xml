&lt;p&gt;Silent Valley National Park, a pristine haven of biodiversity, is nestled in the Nilgiri Hills of Kerala, South India. While the park itself is located in the Palakkad district, it&amp;rsquo;s often referenced in relation to Kanhangad, which is a major town and transportation hub, making it a convenient point of reference for travelers. Situated at an average elevation of 900 meters (2,950 ft) above sea level, this national park is a treasure trove of unique flora and fauna. Silent Valley&amp;rsquo;s claim to fame lies in its remarkably preserved evergreen rainforest, often considered the last significant tract of undisturbed tropical rainforest in the Western Ghats. Its tranquility and untouched natural beauty make it a truly exceptional destination. The park is approximately 40km from the town of Mannarkkad in the Palakkad District.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
