&lt;p&gt;Yelagiri Hills, a serene hill station nestled in the Vellore district of Tamil Nadu, offers a tranquil escape from the bustling city life. Situated at an altitude of approximately 1,100 meters (3,600 feet) above sea level, this relatively unexplored paradise is a hidden gem, offering a refreshing climate, lush greenery, and a sense of peace. It lies approximately 225 kilometers (140 miles) from Chennai and is close to other popular destinations like Bangalore (approximately 150 km / 93 miles) making it an accessible weekend getaway. Yelagiri is primarily known for its natural beauty, offering breathtaking views, adventure opportunities, and a glimpse into the simple, rural life of the local communities.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
