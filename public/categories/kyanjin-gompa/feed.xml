&lt;p&gt;Chandratal Lake, often called the &amp;ldquo;Moon Lake&amp;rdquo; for its crescent shape, is a high-altitude lake situated in the Lahaul and Spiti district of Himachal Pradesh, India. Nestled within the Kyanjin Gompa region, it is one of the most breathtaking destinations in the Himalayas, renowned for its pristine beauty and dramatic landscapes. Located at an elevation of approximately 4,300 meters (14,100 feet) above sea level, Chandratal is a jewel of the Spiti Valley. It&amp;rsquo;s positioned near the Kunzum Pass, a gateway to the Spiti Valley, and is roughly 95 kilometers from Keylong, the administrative center of Lahaul. Its relative proximity to popular tourist destinations like Manali and Kaza makes it an accessible yet rewarding stop for those seeking to experience the raw beauty of the high mountains. Chandratal is unique for its crystal-clear waters that reflect the surrounding peaks, its vibrant meadows, and the tranquility it offers to visitors.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
