      <description>&lt;h3 id=&#34;introduction&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Introduction&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Mahabalipuram, also known as Mamallapuram, is a historic coastal town located in the Kanchipuram district of Tamil Nadu, India. Situated on the Coromandel Coast, approximately 58 kilometers (36 miles) south of Chennai, the state&amp;rsquo;s capital, Mahabalipuram is renowned for its stunning rock-cut temples and monuments, primarily built during the Pallava dynasty in the 7th and 8th centuries. The town lies at sea level, offering beautiful views of the Bay of Bengal. What truly sets Mahabalipuram apart is its exceptional blend of art, architecture, and history, making it a UNESCO World Heritage Site and a must-visit destination for anyone interested in South Indian culture and heritage.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
