&lt;p&gt;Chikmagalur, a verdant hill station nestled in the state of Karnataka, India, is often referred to as the &amp;ldquo;Coffee Land of Karnataka.&amp;rdquo; Situated in the foothills of the Mullayanagiri range, part of the Western Ghats, Chikmagalur boasts an idyllic landscape with lush green hills, cascading waterfalls, and sprawling coffee plantations. The town is located at an average elevation of 1,090 meters (3,576 feet) above sea level, offering a cool and pleasant climate throughout the year. It is approximately 243 kilometers from Bangalore, the state capital, and is a popular getaway for those seeking a respite from city life. Chikmagalur&amp;rsquo;s uniqueness lies in its blend of natural beauty, rich cultural heritage, and, of course, its profound association with coffee cultivation.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
