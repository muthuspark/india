      <description>&lt;h3 id=&#34;introduction&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Introduction&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The Nagaland Hornbill Festival, hosted annually in Kohima, Nagaland, is a vibrant celebration of the Naga heritage, a kaleidoscope of culture, dance, music, and tradition. This iconic festival, held at the Naga Heritage Village (Kisama), approximately 10 km from the state capital, Kohima, is a significant event, offering a window into the fascinating lives and customs of the Naga people. Kohima sits at an elevation of around 1,444 meters (4,737 feet), nestled in the mountainous terrain of Nagaland, and is easily accessible from Dimapur, the state&amp;rsquo;s only airport, roughly 74 km away. The Hornbill Festival is unique because it brings together the rich tapestry of sixteen Naga tribes, allowing visitors to witness their distinct dances, songs, crafts, and rituals, all in one place. It&amp;rsquo;s a festival of unity, celebrating the diversity that makes Nagaland so special.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
