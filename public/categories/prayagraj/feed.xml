&lt;p&gt;The Kumbh Mela Grounds in Prayagraj (formerly Allahabad), Uttar Pradesh, India, is not just a location; it is a temporal and spatial epicenter of faith, culture, and human congregation. Situated at the confluence (Sangam) of three major rivers—the Ganges (Ganga), Yamuna, and the mythical Saraswati—Prayagraj holds immense religious significance for Hindus. The Kumbh Mela, the largest peaceful gathering in the world, is held here cyclically, attracting tens of millions of pilgrims from across India and the globe. The grounds themselves are temporary, transforming into a vibrant tent city during the Mela, encompassing an area that can stretch over several square kilometers along the riverbanks. Prayagraj is located in the Allahabad district of Uttar Pradesh, with no significant elevation. It lies approximately 200 km (124 mi) southeast of the state capital, Lucknow, and is strategically positioned for access from major cities like Delhi and Varanasi. The unique characteristic of the Kumbh Mela Grounds lies in its ability to host this massive gathering, creating a microcosm of Indian culture and spirituality within a designated, albeit temporary, space.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
