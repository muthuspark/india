      <description>&lt;h3 id=&#34;introduction&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Introduction&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Kesaria Stupa, a colossal brick structure nestled in the East Champaran district of Bihar, India, stands as a testament to the rich Buddhist heritage of the region.  Its imposing size and historical significance have made it a key destination for both spiritual pilgrims and history enthusiasts. Situated approximately 110 kilometers north of Patna, the capital of Bihar, and about 35 kilometers from the district headquarters of Motihari, Kesaria Stupa is a significant landmark on the ancient Buddhist pilgrimage route. This massive structure, often compared to the Borobudur Temple in Indonesia, is believed to be the largest stupa in India, making it a truly unique site.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
