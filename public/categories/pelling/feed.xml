      <description>&lt;h3 id=&#34;introduction&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Introduction&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Pelling, a serene town nestled in the West Sikkim district of the Indian state of Sikkim, offers breathtaking views of the snow-capped Kanchenjunga, the world&amp;rsquo;s third-highest peak. Situated at an altitude of approximately 2,150 meters (7,200 feet), Pelling is a popular tourist destination, serving as a gateway to many other attractions in West Sikkim. Its strategic location, relatively close to the capital Gangtok (approximately 115 km), and proximity to the ancient Pemayangtse Monastery make it a compelling place to experience the natural beauty and cultural richness of the region. Pelling is unique for its panoramic vistas, a blend of ancient monasteries, historical ruins, and the accessibility it offers to some of Sikkim&amp;rsquo;s most important cultural and natural sites.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
