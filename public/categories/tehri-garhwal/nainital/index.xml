      <description>&lt;h3 id=&#34;introduction&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Introduction&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Rajaji National Park, a captivating haven of biodiversity in Uttarakhand, is a sprawling protected area that straddles the foothills of the Himalayas. While primarily associated with the Haridwar and Dehradun districts, a portion of the park extends into the Tehri Garhwal district, providing an additional dimension to its ecological tapestry. The park derives its name from C. Rajagopalachari, a prominent freedom fighter and the first Indian Governor-General of India. Situated at an average elevation of 900-1000 meters, the park&amp;rsquo;s location offers stunning views of the Shivalik Range and the Gangetic plains. Its proximity to popular destinations like Haridwar, Rishikesh, and Dehradun makes it a convenient escape for nature enthusiasts and adventure seekers. What makes Rajaji National Park unique is its diverse ecosystem, encompassing dense forests, riverine habitats, and a rich array of wildlife, including the majestic Bengal tiger and the Asian elephant, all within easy reach of major cities.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
