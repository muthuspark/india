      <description>&lt;h3 id=&#34;introduction&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Introduction&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Rishikesh, nestled in the foothills of the Himalayas in the northern Indian state of Uttarakhand, is a vibrant spiritual and adventure hub. Situated along the banks of the sacred Ganges River, Rishikesh boasts a tranquil atmosphere intertwined with a pulsating energy that attracts both pilgrims and adventure seekers. Located at an elevation of approximately 1,360 feet (415 meters), it sits approximately 25 kilometers (16 miles) from the state capital, Dehradun. Rishikesh&amp;rsquo;s unique blend of spirituality, adventure, and natural beauty makes it a compelling destination. The town is often referred to as the &amp;ldquo;Yoga Capital of the World&amp;rdquo; and is a gateway to the Char Dham pilgrimage sites. Its proximity to other popular destinations like Haridwar (20 km) and Mussoorie (75 km) further enhances its appeal.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
