      <description>&lt;h3 id=&#34;introduction&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Introduction&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Kangla Fort, a historical and archaeological site of immense significance, stands as a proud testament to the rich history and cultural heritage of Manipur, India. Situated in the heart of Imphal, the capital city of Manipur, the fort is strategically located on the western bank of the Imphal River, locally known as the &lt;em&gt;Nambul River&lt;/em&gt;. Though its exact elevation is not precisely documented, it occupies a prime position in the city. The fort is easily accessible, lying close to other popular destinations within Imphal such as the Shree Govindajee Temple and the Imphal War Cemetery.
