      <description>&lt;h3 id=&#34;introduction&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Introduction&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Dwarka, a sacred city steeped in legend and history, is a revered destination nestled on the western coast of Gujarat, India. Though geographically located in the Devbhoomi Dwarka district, its historical and spiritual significance is inextricably linked to the nearby city of Porbandar, the birthplace of Mahatma Gandhi.  It sits near the confluence of the Gomti River with the Arabian Sea. Dwarka holds immense importance in Hinduism, believed to be the ancient kingdom of Lord Krishna. Its location is approximately 137 kilometers from Porbandar and around 375 kilometers from Ahmedabad. This coastal city offers a unique blend of spirituality, ancient architecture, vibrant culture, and stunning natural beauty, making it a compelling destination for both pilgrims and tourists.  It stands at a low elevation along the coastline.  The area is known for its calm waters, ancient temples, and opportunities to connect with Indian history.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
