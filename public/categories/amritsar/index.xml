      <description>&lt;h3 id=&#34;introduction&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Introduction&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The Golden Temple, officially known as Harmandir Sahib (meaning &amp;ldquo;Abode of God&amp;rdquo;), is the holiest Gurdwara (Sikh place of worship) located in the city of Amritsar, Punjab, India. Situated in the heart of Amritsar, this iconic structure is a shimmering testament to Sikh faith and architecture. Amritsar itself sits in the fertile plains of Punjab, and the Golden Temple is a central point, drawing pilgrims and tourists alike. The temple is not just a religious site but also a symbol of peace, equality, and brotherhood, offering free meals (langar) to all visitors regardless of faith or background.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
