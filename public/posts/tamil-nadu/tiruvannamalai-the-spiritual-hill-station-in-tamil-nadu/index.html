      <h3 id="introduction"><strong>Introduction</strong></h3>
<p>The Annamalai Hills, also known as Arunachala, stand majestically in Tiruvannamalai, Tamil Nadu, a beacon of spirituality and natural beauty. Located in the northeastern part of Tamil Nadu, approximately 185 kilometers southwest of Chennai, these hills are renowned for their association with Lord Shiva and are a major pilgrimage site for Hindus. The hills are dominated by the sacred Arunachala mountain, reaching a height of approximately 817 meters (2,680 feet). Its proximity to other popular destinations like Pondicherry (110 km) and Kanchipuram (120 km) makes it a convenient stop for travelers exploring the region. The unique essence of Annamalai Hills is a blend of spiritual power, striking landscapes, and a rich cultural heritage, drawing devotees, nature lovers, and adventure seekers alike.</p>
<h3 id="history-and-cultural-heritage"><strong>History and Cultural Heritage</strong></h3>
<p>The history of Annamalai Hills is deeply intertwined with Hindu mythology, particularly the legend of Lord Shiva appearing as a column of fire (Agni Lingam) on Arunachala. The ancient temple, Arunachaleswarar Temple, located at the base of the hills, is a testament to the region&rsquo;s long and rich cultural heritage. Dating back over a millennium, the temple is believed to have been constructed by various dynasties, including the Cholas, Pandyas, Hoysalas, and Vijayanagara Empire.</p>
<p>The area is a vibrant hub of Hindu traditions, with numerous festivals and rituals observed throughout the year. The most significant is the <em>Karthigai Deepam</em> festival, celebrated annually in the Tamil month of Karthigai (November/December), where a giant lamp is lit atop Arunachala, visible for miles around. The <em>Girivalam</em>, a 14-kilometer circumambulation of Arunachala mountain, is a profound spiritual practice undertaken by thousands of devotees daily, especially during the full moon. This act is believed to cleanse the soul and bring spiritual enlightenment. The area’s history is also reflected in the presence of several ashrams, caves, and holy sites associated with saints and sages, including Ramana Maharshi, who spent many years meditating in the area.</p>
