<p>Lambasingi, often referred to as the &ldquo;Kashmir of Andhra Pradesh,&rdquo; is a quaint and picturesque hill station nestled in the Eastern Ghats, within the Visakhapatnam district of Andhra Pradesh, India. Perched at an elevation of approximately 1,025 meters (3,363 feet) above sea level, Lambasingi is renowned for its exceptionally low temperatures, often experiencing sub-zero conditions during the winter months, a rare phenomenon for South India. Its proximity to the bustling city of Visakhapatnam, roughly 100 kilometers (62 miles) away, makes it an accessible escape for those seeking a cooler climate and a tranquil retreat from the heat and humidity of the plains.
