<p>Ethipothala Falls, a breathtaking natural wonder, cascades down from a height of approximately 70 feet into the Krishna River. Located in the Guntur district of Andhra Pradesh, India, the falls are situated roughly 18 km from Nagarjuna Sagar Dam and approximately 150 km from Machilipatnam, making it a popular day-trip destination for tourists and locals alike.
