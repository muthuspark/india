<p>Talakona Waterfalls, a breathtaking cascade nestled in the Seshachalam Hills of Andhra Pradesh, presents a mesmerizing spectacle of nature&rsquo;s grandeur. While often associated with the broader region, it&rsquo;s crucial to understand that Talakona is located in the Chittoor district, and not Visakhapatnam.

		<p class="text-normal leading-normal text-zinc-500 line-clamp-2">Constructed around 261 BCE during Emperor Ashoka&#39;s reign, Hirakud Dam is one of India&#39;s and Asia&#39;s oldest stone dams. Built to control the river Mahanadi and prevent floods, it spans approximately 2 kilometers near Sisupalgarh. The dam features two spillways and tunnels, showcasing ancient engineering prowess. Still standing today, it reflects Ashoka&#39;s network of water management systems and remains a historical marvel.</p>
