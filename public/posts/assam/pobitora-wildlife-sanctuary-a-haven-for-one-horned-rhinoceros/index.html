      <h3 id="introduction"><strong>Introduction</strong></h3>
<p>Pobitora Wildlife Sanctuary, a jewel of Assam, is a haven for wildlife enthusiasts and nature lovers. Situated in the Morigaon district of Assam, approximately 30 km east of Guwahati, it&rsquo;s renowned for its exceptionally high density of the Indian rhinoceros ( <em>Rhinoceros unicornis</em>). This sanctuary offers a unique and immersive experience, allowing visitors to witness these majestic creatures in their natural habitat. Though located in Morigaon, Pobitora is also close to the Golaghat district, adding to its accessibility for travelers exploring this northeastern Indian state. While the elevation of the sanctuary is relatively low, it is characterized by its wetlands, grasslands, and scattered patches of forest, making it a prime location for wildlife observation. Its proximity to Guwahati makes it an easily accessible day trip or a convenient stopover for those exploring the broader region.</p>

<p>The historical narrative of Pobitora is intertwined with the broader history of Assam. The region, once part of the ancient Kamarupa kingdom, has witnessed numerous dynasties and periods of socio-political changes. The sanctuary itself, however, gained its significance primarily through its ecological importance. It was initially declared a Reserve Forest and later designated as a Wildlife Sanctuary in 1971. This designation reflects the increasing awareness of the importance of conserving the one-horned rhinoceros, whose population was dwindling significantly. The local communities, primarily the Tiwa tribe, have played a crucial role in the conservation efforts, highlighting the importance of community involvement in environmental protection. The cultural heritage of the area is influenced by the various ethnic groups residing in the region. While there are no significant historical landmarks within the sanctuary, the surrounding villages offer glimpses into the local culture, with traditional weaving, handicrafts, and festivals.
