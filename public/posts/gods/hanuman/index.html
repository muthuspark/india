      <h2 id="hanuman-the-embodiment-of-devotion-and-strength">Hanuman: The Embodiment of Devotion and Strength</h2>
<h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>
<p>Hanuman, also known as Anjaneya, is one of the most beloved and revered deities in Hinduism. He is celebrated for his unparalleled devotion to Lord Rama, his extraordinary strength, unwavering courage, and selfless service. Often depicted as a monkey-faced humanoid, Hanuman embodies the ideals of <em>bhakti</em> (devotion), <em>shakti</em> (power), and <em>buddhi</em> (wisdom). His iconography typically portrays him as a muscular figure, often carrying the <em>gada</em> (mace), a symbol of his might. Hanuman holds a prominent position in the Hindu pantheon, particularly within the Vaishnava tradition, and is venerated as a protector, a source of strength, and a symbol of unwavering faith.</p>
<h3 id="etymology-and-names">Etymology and Names</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Hanuman:</strong> The most common name, &ldquo;Hanuman,&rdquo; is believed to derive from the Sanskrit words &ldquo;Hanu&rdquo; (jaw) and &ldquo;man&rdquo; (prominent or disfigured). One interpretation suggests that this refers to an incident in his childhood when Indra, the king of gods, struck him with his thunderbolt (Vajra) on the jaw, causing a slight disfigurement. Another explanation links it to the Sanskrit word &lsquo;Hanumat&rsquo; (having large cheeks).</li>
<li><strong>Anjaneya/Anjani Putra:</strong> These names denote his lineage, meaning &ldquo;son of Anjana.&rdquo; Anjana was his mother, an apsara (celestial nymph) who was cursed to be born as a monkey woman.</li>
<li><strong>Maruti:</strong> This name refers to his father, Vayu, the wind god, also known as Marut. Hence, Maruti means &ldquo;son of Marut.&rdquo;</li>
<li><strong>Mahaveera:</strong> This title signifies &ldquo;great hero,&rdquo; highlighting his exceptional bravery and prowess.</li>
<li><strong>Bajrangbali:</strong> A popular epithet, particularly in North India, &ldquo;Bajrangbali&rdquo; translates to &ldquo;strong-bodied one&rdquo; or &ldquo;one with a body as strong as Vajra,&rdquo; alluding to his invulnerability.</li>
<li><strong>Kesari Nandan:</strong> Meaning &ldquo;son of Kesari,&rdquo; Kesari was his adoptive father and Anjana&rsquo;s husband.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="mythological-origins">Mythological Origins</h3>
<p>The birth of Hanuman is often attributed to divine intervention. According to the most prevalent narrative, Anjana, after performing intense penance, received a boon from Vayu, the wind god, who impregnated her with his divine energy. This divine energy, combined with the blessings of Shiva, resulted in the birth of Hanuman.</p>
<p>Some Puranic accounts suggest that Anjana was granted a fruit by Agni, the fire god, after she worshipped Shiva. Consuming this fruit led to the conception of Hanuman, who is therefore considered an incarnation of Shiva.</p>
<p>Hanuman has no known siblings in the standard Ramayana narrative. He is regarded as the sole offspring of Anjana and Vayu (or Shiva, depending on the account).</p>
<h3 id="major-scriptures-and-references">Major Scriptures and References</h3>
<p>Hanuman&rsquo;s exploits and significance are detailed in several key Hindu scriptures:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Valmiki Ramayana:</strong> This epic is the primary source for the story of Hanuman. It vividly describes his birth, his role in assisting Rama in rescuing Sita, and his unwavering devotion. Hanuman&rsquo;s character is central to the Ramayana&rsquo;s themes of devotion, loyalty, and selfless service.</li>
<li><strong>Ramcharitmanas (Tulsidas):</strong> This 16th-century Awadhi retelling of the Ramayana popularized Hanuman devotion in North India. Tulsidas portrays Hanuman as the ideal devotee and an accessible deity for the common person.</li>
<li><strong>Mahabharata:</strong> Hanuman makes a brief appearance in the Mahabharata, where he encounters Bhima, one of the Pandava brothers. He tests Bhima&rsquo;s strength and imparts spiritual wisdom.</li>
<li><strong>Puranas:</strong> Several Puranas, including the Brahma Purana, Vishnu Purana, and Shiva Purana, contain stories about Hanuman, elaborating on his birth, powers, and significance.</li>
<li><strong>Hanuman Chalisa:</strong> A devotional hymn written by Tulsidas, the Hanuman Chalisa is a concise and powerful prayer that encapsulates Hanuman&rsquo;s virtues and his ability to grant protection and blessings.</li>
<li><strong>Hanuman Ashtak:</strong> A hymn of eight verses, glorifying Hanuman.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="roles-and-functions">Roles and Functions</h3>
<p>Hanuman plays a vital role in the cosmic order as a devotee, protector, and messenger of dharma.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Devotee:</strong> Hanuman is the quintessential devotee, embodying the ideals of <em>bhakti</em>. His unwavering faith in Rama serves as a model for spiritual aspirants.</li>
<li><strong>Protector:</strong> Hanuman is widely regarded as a protector against evil forces and negativity. He is invoked for strength, courage, and protection from harm.</li>

<li><strong>Grantor of Boons:</strong> Many devotees believe Hanuman has the power to grant boons and fulfill desires, especially those related to strength, courage, and devotion.</li>
<li><strong>Moksha:</strong> Although not primarily associated with the Trimurti duties of creation, preservation and destruction, Hanuman&rsquo;s unwavering devotion to Rama, embodying <em>bhakti</em>, is seen as a pathway to <em>moksha</em> (liberation). He embodies the idea that through selfless service and devotion, one can attain spiritual freedom.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="avatars-and-manifestations">Avatars and Manifestations</h3>

He remains largely consistent in his persona throughout Hindu mythology. However, some regional traditions and interpretations identify variations or aspects of Hanuman that can be considered manifestations of his divine power and devotion. These are not necessarily seen as distinct incarnations but rather as different facets of his essence. One notable example:</p>
<ul>
