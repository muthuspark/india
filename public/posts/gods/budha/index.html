He is regarded as the deity of wit, intelligence, commerce, and communication. Often depicted as a youthful and handsome figure, Budha influences the mental and intellectual capacities of individuals.

He is usually depicted holding a book, representing knowledge, and sometimes a sword, symbolizing intellect. He is often seated on a lion or a carpet.</p><p><strong>Significance in Hinduism:</strong> Budha holds a prominent position in Hindu astrology and is worshipped for blessings of wisdom, eloquence, and success in business. He is considered benevolent and influences intellectual pursuits, education, and communication skills. Worshipping Budha is believed to mitigate the negative effects of Mercury in a birth chart and enhance positive qualities.</p><h3 id=etymology-and-names>Etymology and Names</h3><p><strong>Meaning and Origin of the Name:</strong> The name &ldquo;Budha&rdquo; (बुध) comes from the Sanskrit root <em>budh</em>, meaning &ldquo;to know,&rdquo; &ldquo;to perceive,&rdquo; or &ldquo;to awaken.&rdquo; It signifies knowledge, wisdom, and understanding.</p><p><strong>Other Names and Titles:</strong> Budha is known by several other names, each reflecting different aspects of his character and role:</p><ul><li><strong>Saumya (सौम्य):</strong> Meaning &ldquo;gentle,&rdquo; &ldquo;handsome,&rdquo; or &ldquo;son of the moon god,&rdquo; referring to his supposed parentage.</li><li><strong>Rohineya (रोहिणेय):</strong> &ldquo;Son of Rohini,&rdquo; another epithet referring to his mother.</li><li><strong>Tunga (तुंग):</strong> Meaning &ldquo;exalted&rdquo; or &ldquo;high,&rdquo; possibly referring to his elevated position among the Navagrahas.</li><li><strong>Kumara (कुमार):</strong> Meaning &ldquo;youth&rdquo; or &ldquo;prince,&rdquo; emphasizing his youthful appearance.</li><li><strong>Jnanin (ज्ञानिन्):</strong> Meaning &ldquo;possessor of knowledge.&rdquo;</li></ul><h3 id=mythological-origins>Mythological Origins</h3><p><strong>Birth or Manifestation Stories:</strong> The most widely accepted origin story of Budha is found in the Puranas. According to this narrative, Budha is the son of Chandra (the moon god) and Tara, the wife of Brihaspati (the guru of the gods). The story recounts that Tara was abducted by Chandra, and their union resulted in the birth of Budha. Brihaspati eventually reclaimed Tara, and Budha was recognized as Chandra&rsquo;s son.</p><p><strong>Lineage:</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Parents:</strong> Chandra (Moon) and Tara (wife of Brihaspati).</li><li><strong>Spouse:</strong> Ila. In some versions, Ila is a gender-shifting deity, further complicating Budha&rsquo;s lineage.</li><li><strong>Son:</strong> Pururavas, a legendary king of the Lunar dynasty.</li></ul><h3 id=major-scriptures-and-references>Major Scriptures and References</h3><p><strong>Mentions in Vedas, Upanishads, Puranas, Epics:</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Vedas:</strong> While Budha is not explicitly mentioned in the Rigveda by name, some scholars suggest that certain hymns related to knowledge and understanding can be associated with the qualities represented by Budha.</li><li><strong>Upanishads:</strong> The Upanishads emphasize the importance of knowledge and wisdom, which align with Budha&rsquo;s characteristics, though direct references are rare.</li><li><strong>Puranas:</strong> The Puranas, such as the Vishnu Purana, Brahma Purana, and Bhagavata Purana, contain detailed accounts of Budha&rsquo;s birth, lineage, and significance.

His influence is primarily felt through his role as a Graha (planet) impacting individual lives and events on Earth. However, his association with wisdom and knowledge makes him connected, in some interpretations, to those who exemplify these qualities.</p><h3 id=symbols-and-iconography>Symbols and Iconography</h3><p><strong>Typical Depictions:</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Complexion:</strong> Usually depicted with a green complexion.</li><li><strong>Posture:</strong> Often seated on a lion or a carpet.</li><li><strong>Clothing:</strong> Wears yellow or green garments.</li><li><strong>Number of Arms:</strong> Usually two or four arms.</li></ul><p><strong>Symbolic Meanings of Objects Held or Worn:</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Book:</strong> Represents knowledge, learning, and intellectual pursuits.</li><li><strong>Sword:</strong> Symbolizes the sharpness of intellect and the ability to discern truth from falsehood.</li><li><strong>Rosary (Akshamala):</strong> Represents the cycle of time and the importance of constant learning and self-improvement.</li><li><strong>Vahana (Mount/Vehicle):</strong> A lion (representing courage and strength) or a carpet (representing comfort and material well-being).</li></ul><h3 id=temples-and-worship>Temples and Worship</h3><p><strong>Famous Temples:</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Sri Budhan Temple, Thiruvenkadu, Tamil Nadu:</strong> One of the most prominent temples dedicated to Budha, considered a powerful place for seeking blessings related to education and career.</li><li><strong>Navagraha Temples:</strong> Many Navagraha temples across India include shrines dedicated to Budha as one of the nine planetary deities.</li></ul><p><strong>Common Rituals, Festivals, and Prayers:</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Budha Puja:</strong> Performed to appease Budha and seek his blessings.
