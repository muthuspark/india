Nestled within the Kyanjin Gompa region, it is one of the most breathtaking destinations in the Himalayas, renowned for its pristine beauty and dramatic landscapes.

A specific viewpoint along the trekking route provides breathtaking panoramic views of the lake and its surrounding mountains, especially during sunrise or sunset when the colors are most vibrant.

The landscape is characterized by arid beauty with stark contrasts between the harsh terrain and the gentle curves of the lake. While there are no formal parks or reserves directly at the lake, the entire area falls within a protected zone and is part of the larger Spiti Valley&rsquo;s ecologically sensitive environment.</p>
