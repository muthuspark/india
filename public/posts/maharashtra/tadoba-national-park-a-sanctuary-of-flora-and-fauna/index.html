Spanning an area of approximately 625 square kilometers, it&rsquo;s one of India&rsquo;s oldest and largest national parks.

Historically, the area was part of the Gondwana region, and remnants of Gondwana tribal settlements can still be found in the fringes of the park. The British colonial era saw limited intervention in the area, but the value of conserving its rich biodiversity was recognized in the early 20th century. Tadoba was declared a national park in 1955, aiming to protect its tigers and other wildlife.</p>
