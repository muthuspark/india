      <h3 id="introduction"><strong>Introduction</strong></h3>
<p>Sohra, also known by its colonial name, Cherrapunji, is a breathtaking hill station nestled in the East Khasi Hills district of Meghalaya, India. Perched at an elevation of approximately 1,484 meters (4,870 feet), Sohra is renowned as one of the wettest places on Earth, earning it the moniker &ldquo;The Abode of the Clouds.&rdquo; Its dramatic landscapes, cascading waterfalls, lush green valleys, and unique living root bridges make it a coveted destination for nature enthusiasts, adventure seekers, and those looking for an escape into pristine wilderness. Located just 53 km (33 miles) from the state capital, Shillong, Sohra serves as a gateway to exploring the diverse and captivating beauty of Meghalaya.</p>
<h3 id="history-and-cultural-heritage"><strong>History and Cultural Heritage</strong></h3>
<p>The history of Sohra is deeply intertwined with the indigenous Khasi people, who have inhabited the region for centuries. The Khasi Hills were once ruled by independent Khasi chiefs, known as &ldquo;Siems,&rdquo; until the British annexed the region in the 19th century. Sohra, due to its high rainfall and strategic location, became a significant British administrative center. The British presence left a mark on the architecture and infrastructure of the town, contributing to its colonial charm.</p>
<p>The Khasi culture is matrilineal, meaning inheritance and lineage are traced through the mother&rsquo;s line. This unique social structure, along with their distinct language, traditions, and customs, distinguishes the Khasis. The Nongsawlia Presbyterian Church, established in 1841, stands as a testament to the early Christian influence in the area.  Major festivals, like the <em>Nongkrem Dance</em>, showcase traditional Khasi music, dance, and attire, and are a vibrant display of their rich heritage.</p>

One of the most prominent natural features is the extensive network of caves, including the Mawsmai Caves and the Arwah Caves. These caves are known for their unique rock formations and stalactites and stalagmites. The landscape is crisscrossed by fast-flowing rivers and streams, creating dramatic gorges and canyons.
