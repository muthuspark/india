The landscape is verdant, nourished by the abundant rainfall that defines the region&rsquo;s climate. The caves themselves are formed within limestone formations, showcasing intricate stalactite and stalagmite formations. The interplay of light and shadow within the caves further enhances their ethereal beauty. The surrounding area offers stunning viewpoints from which visitors can appreciate the panoramic vistas of the Khasi Hills and the valleys below.</p><h3 id=must-visit-attractions><strong>Must-Visit Attractions</strong></h3><p>The primary attraction at Mawsmai is, of course, the caves themselves.
