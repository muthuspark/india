      <h3 id="introduction"><strong>Introduction</strong></h3>
<p>McLeod Ganj, often referred to as &ldquo;Little Lhasa&rdquo; or &ldquo;Dharamsala Upper,&rdquo; is a mesmerizing hill station situated in the Kangra district of Himachal Pradesh, India. Nestled in the Dhauladhar range of the Himalayas, it sits at an elevation of approximately 2,082 meters (6,831 feet). This vibrant town is renowned not only for its stunning natural beauty but also for being the seat of the 14th Dalai Lama and the Tibetan government-in-exile. Its proximity to Dharamsala, only about 9 kilometers away, makes it an easily accessible and popular destination for travelers seeking a blend of spirituality, adventure, and cultural immersion.

This pivotal moment transformed the town, infusing it with a rich Tibetan cultural heritage.</p>
<p>The cultural tapestry of McLeod Ganj is woven with the threads of Tibetan Buddhism, evident in the numerous monasteries, including the Tsuglagkhang Complex, which houses the Dalai Lama&rsquo;s temple. Festivals like Losar (Tibetan New Year) and Saga Dawa (celebrating the birth and enlightenment of Buddha) are vibrant expressions of Tibetan culture, with colorful processions, traditional dances, and elaborate rituals. Historical landmarks include the Tibetan Museum, showcasing Tibetan art, history, and the struggle for independence.
