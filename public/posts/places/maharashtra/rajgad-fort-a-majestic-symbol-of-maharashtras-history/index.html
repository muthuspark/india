		<p class="text-normal leading-normal text-zinc-500 line-clamp-2">Agra Fort is a grand Mughal fort in Agra, Uttar Pradesh, India. It was built by Emperor Akbar in 1565 and served as the capital of India during the Mughal era. The fort is renowned for its intricate architecture, including the Diwan-i-Am (Hall of Public Audience), Diwan-i-Khas (Hall of Private Audience), and the impressive gateway known as the Hathi Pol (Elephant Gate). It also houses the Gurudwara where Guru Tegh Bahadur, the ninth Sikh Guru, was imprisoned by Emperor Aurangzeb.</p>
