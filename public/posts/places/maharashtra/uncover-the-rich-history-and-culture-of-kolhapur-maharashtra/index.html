Located approximately 225 kilometers (140 miles) south of Pune, Kolhapur sits on the banks of the Panchaganga River and offers a delightful blend of the traditional and the contemporary. The city’s elevation is around 555 meters (1,821 feet) above sea level. It&rsquo;s a significant cultural hub, renowned for its royalty, wrestling (Kushti), distinctive cuisine, and the revered Mahalaxmi Temple, drawing visitors from across the country and the globe. This city is a gateway to the Sahyadri mountain range and is often a starting point for exploring the Western Ghats.</p><h3 id=history-and-cultural-heritage><strong>History and Cultural Heritage</strong></h3><p>Kolhapur boasts a rich historical lineage, dating back to ancient times. It was once a prominent seat of the Shilahara dynasty and later flourished under the Maratha Empire, particularly during the reign of Chhatrapati Shahu Maharaj, a progressive ruler who championed social reforms and education. The British colonial period saw the city becoming a princely state, further shaping its cultural identity.</p><p>The cultural heart of Kolhapur beats strongest in its festivals and traditions. The city is known for its vibrant celebrations of the annual <em>Ganeshotsav</em> (Ganesh Chaturthi), <em>Sharda Navratri</em>, and the <em>Mahalaxmi Yatra</em>, a grand pilgrimage to the Mahalaxmi Temple. Wrestling, or <em>Kushti</em>, is deeply ingrained in the local culture, with numerous <em>akhadas</em> (wrestling schools) and regular competitions. The region also boasts traditional art forms like the <em>Kolhapuri Saaj</em> (a traditional necklace) and handcrafted leather items. The Kolhapur Municipal Corporation is working to promote this heritage even further by offering guided cultural walks and heritage tourism experiences.</p><p>The city is also home to numerous historical landmarks.
