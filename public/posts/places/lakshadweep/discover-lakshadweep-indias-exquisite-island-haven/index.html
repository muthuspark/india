Located approximately 400 kilometers (250 miles) off the southwestern coast of India, this island is the administrative center of the Union Territory of Lakshadweep.

Over time, the islands converted to Islam, profoundly influencing the culture and traditions that are still prevalent today. The islands were later controlled by the Portuguese for a brief period, followed by the Arakkal dynasty of Kannur. In the late 18th century, the British East India Company took control of the islands, eventually integrating them into British India.
