      <h3 id="introduction"><strong>Introduction</strong></h3>
<p>Manas National Park, a UNESCO Natural World Heritage site, a Project Tiger Reserve, an Elephant Reserve, and a Biosphere Reserve, is nestled in the foothills of the Eastern Himalayas in the state of Assam, India. Located in the Manas region, the park straddles the international border with Bhutan, with the Royal Manas National Park of Bhutan forming a contiguous protected area. Situated at an average elevation ranging from 100 to 400 meters above sea level, Manas offers a stunning tapestry of landscapes, from grassy savannas and dense tropical forests to meandering rivers and rolling hills. Its proximity to Guwahati (approximately 176 km) makes it relatively accessible, drawing nature enthusiasts, wildlife lovers, and adventure seekers alike. Manas is uniquely known for its rich biodiversity, supporting a wide array of flora and fauna, including several endangered species like the tiger, the one-horned rhinoceros, and the golden langur. The park&rsquo;s pristine environment and scenic beauty provide a haven for wildlife and a breathtaking experience for visitors.</p>
<h3 id="history-and-cultural-heritage"><strong>History and Cultural Heritage</strong></h3>
<p>The history of Manas National Park is intertwined with both royal and indigenous influences. The area was initially a reserved forest.

The park&rsquo;s boundaries and conservation efforts were significantly developed after independence, playing a pivotal role in the area&rsquo;s preservation.</p>
<p>Culturally, the region is home to several indigenous communities, including the Bodo, Rabha, and Assamese people. Their culture is rich in traditions, festivals, and handicrafts.  The Bodo people, in particular, have a strong connection to the land and the preservation of its natural resources.  The park and surrounding areas showcase vibrant cultures, with colorful festivals often celebrated, blending the love for nature and rich cultural heritage.
