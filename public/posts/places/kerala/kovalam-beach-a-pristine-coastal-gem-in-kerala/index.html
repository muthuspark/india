Located approximately 16 kilometers (9.9 miles) south of Thiruvananthapuram (Trivandrum), the state capital, Kovalam boasts a low elevation, making it easily accessible and a popular retreat for travelers seeking relaxation and natural beauty. What sets Kovalam apart is its unique combination of pristine beaches, Ayurvedic traditions, and a laid-back atmosphere, offering an idyllic escape for all types of travelers, from families to solo adventurers.

She built the Halcyon Castle (now a luxury hotel) in 1932, which significantly contributed to Kovalam’s development as a tourist destination. The beach, which was once a secluded spot, slowly began to attract attention from European visitors seeking a peaceful retreat.</p><p>Culturally, Kovalam reflects Kerala&rsquo;s rich traditions.
