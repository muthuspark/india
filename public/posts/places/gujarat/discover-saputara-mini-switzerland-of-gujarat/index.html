<p>Saputara, a charming hill station nestled in the Sahyadri mountain range of the Western Ghats, is the only hill station in the state of Gujarat, India. Located in the Dang district and positioned specifically within the <em>Vailanki</em> region of Gujarat, Saputara offers a refreshing escape from the scorching heat of the plains. At an elevation of approximately 1,000 meters (3,300 feet) above sea level, it provides cool and pleasant weather throughout most of the year. This picturesque destination is known for its lush green landscapes, serene lakes, dense forests, and vibrant tribal culture.

The area was historically a part of the Dangs district, which remained relatively isolated until the 20th century. The impact of colonial rule was less pronounced here compared to other parts of Gujarat. Saputara&rsquo;s development as a tourist destination gained momentum in the latter half of the 20th century, with efforts to promote its natural beauty and tribal culture.</p>
