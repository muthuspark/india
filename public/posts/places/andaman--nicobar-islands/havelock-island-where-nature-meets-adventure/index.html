Situated approximately 40 kilometers (25 miles) northeast of Port Blair, the capital of the Andaman and Nicobar Islands, Havelock Island is renowned globally for its pristine beaches, vibrant coral reefs, and lush tropical forests. It boasts a landscape of low-lying hills covered with dense vegetation and offers a truly captivating experience for both adventure seekers and those looking for tranquility. Its elevation is relatively low, mostly at sea level, with the highest points only reaching a few tens of meters. Havelock Island is easily accessible from Port Blair and is a gateway to other stunning islands in the archipelago, making it a cornerstone of any Andaman Islands itinerary. Its unique charm lies in its untouched natural beauty, offering a perfect blend of relaxation and adventure.</p><h3 id=history-and-cultural-heritage><strong>History and Cultural Heritage</strong></h3><p>The history of Havelock Island, like the Andaman and Nicobar Islands as a whole, is marked by colonial influence and indigenous presence. Initially inhabited by indigenous tribes, the islands came under British control in the 18th century. The British used the islands primarily as a penal colony. The island, previously called Havelock Island, was named after Major-General Sir Henry Havelock, a British Army officer, and served as a settlement and a site for resource extraction. After India&rsquo;s independence in 1947, the islands became part of the Indian Union. The name was recently changed to Swaraj Dweep (meaning &ldquo;Self-Rule Island&rdquo; in Hindi) to honour Subhas Chandra Bose, an Indian independence activist.</p><p>The cultural landscape is a diverse mix of indigenous tribal communities and settlers from mainland India, primarily from Bengal and Tamil Nadu, who were brought to the islands for labour. Festivals like Durga Puja and Diwali are celebrated with fervour, alongside local tribal festivals. While Havelock Island isn&rsquo;t rich in significant historical landmarks like ancient temples or monuments in the traditional sense, its heritage is primarily woven into the local lifestyle, traditional practices, and the simple fishing villages that dot its coastline.
