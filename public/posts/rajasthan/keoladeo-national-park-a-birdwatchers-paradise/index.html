      <h3 id="introduction"><strong>Introduction</strong></h3>
<p>Keoladeo National Park, also known as Bharatpur Bird Sanctuary, is a renowned UNESCO World Heritage site located in Bharatpur, Rajasthan, India. This avian paradise sprawls across approximately 29 square kilometers (11 sq mi), offering a vibrant haven for diverse bird species, both resident and migratory. Situated in the eastern part of Rajasthan, it sits at an elevation of about 174 meters (571 ft) above sea level. It is easily accessible from major cities like Delhi (approximately 180 km or 112 mi) and Agra (approximately 55 km or 34 mi), making it a popular day trip or weekend destination. What makes Keoladeo unique is its artificial wetland ecosystem, meticulously crafted by humans over a century ago, which has become a critical wintering ground for a vast array of birds, including some highly endangered species.</p>
<h3 id="history-and-cultural-heritage"><strong>History and Cultural Heritage</strong></h3>
<p>The history of Keoladeo National Park is intertwined with the royal patronage of the Bharatpur state. In the 1850s, the Maharaja of Bharatpur created this wetland ecosystem. The park&rsquo;s name, &ldquo;Keoladeo,&rdquo; is derived from a temple dedicated to Keoladeo, a Hindu deity, situated in the park&rsquo;s core. Initially, the area was used as a hunting reserve for the Maharajas, particularly for duck shoots. The practice of hunting gradually diminished, and in 1971, the area was declared a protected sanctuary. In 1985, it earned the prestigious UNESCO World Heritage site status, recognizing its exceptional biodiversity and conservation efforts. The cultural heritage of the park is subtly reflected in the remnants of the past, including the old bunds and embankments constructed to control water flow. The local communities&rsquo; connection with the park and their role in conservation contribute to its cultural significance.</p>

The landscape is relatively flat, making it ideal for bird watching. During the monsoon season, the park transforms into a vibrant ecosystem as the lakes and marshes fill with water, providing an ideal habitat for various species.
