		<p class="text-normal leading-normal text-zinc-500 line-clamp-2">Amber Fort, also known as Amber Palace, is a historic fort located in Jaipur, Rajasthan. Built by Raja Man Singh I in 1592 and expanded during the reign of Raja Jai Singh II, it is a prime example of Rajasthani architecture. The fort features stunning palaces, such as the Sheesh Mahal (Hall of Mirrors), known for its intricate mirror work and ceiling with tiny mirrors reflecting light from chandeliers. It is one of the most visited tourist attractions in Rajasthan.</p>
