      <h3 id="introduction"><strong>Introduction</strong></h3>
<p>Rajgir, a historical town nestled in the Nalanda district of Bihar, India, is a place steeped in ancient lore and natural beauty. Located approximately 100 kilometers (62 miles) southeast of Patna, the state capital, Rajgir (also known as Rajagriha) is situated in a valley surrounded by the scenic Rajgir Hills. Its elevation is around 200 meters (656 feet) above sea level. Proximity to popular destinations like Nalanda (famous for its ancient university) and Bodh Gaya (the site of Buddha&rsquo;s enlightenment) makes Rajgir a pivotal location for travelers interested in history, spirituality, and nature. Rajgir&rsquo;s unique charm lies in its significance to Buddhism and Jainism, its historical connection to powerful empires, and its tranquil environment offering a serene escape.</p>
<h3 id="history-and-cultural-heritage"><strong>History and Cultural Heritage</strong></h3>
<p>Rajgir&rsquo;s history dates back thousands of years, making it one of the oldest cities in India. It was the first capital of the Magadha Empire, ruled by the powerful Haryanka dynasty.  King Bimbisara, a contemporary of the Buddha, ruled from Rajgir.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> The city is deeply intertwined with the lives of both the Buddha and Mahavira, the 24th Tirthankara of Jainism.  The Buddha spent several years in Rajgir, and many important Buddhist events occurred here, including the first Buddhist council held after his parinirvana (death).  For Jains, Rajgir is significant as Mahavira attained Kevala Jnana (enlightenment) on Mount Vipula.  The area houses several Jain temples and sites.</p>
<p>Rajgir is also rich in cultural heritage.  The various dynasties that ruled over this region – including the Mauryas, Guptas, and others – have left their marks on the architecture and traditions of Rajgir.  Important cultural aspects include the reverence for Buddhism and Jainism, traditional Hindu practices, and local Bihari customs.  Festivals like Buddha Purnima (Vesak), celebrating the Buddha&rsquo;s birth, enlightenment, and death, are major events.  The Rajgir Mahotsav, a cultural festival featuring music, dance, and art, is another prominent event.</p>
<p>Key historical landmarks include: the Cyclopean Wall, built in the pre-Mauryan period, which showcases the ancient city&rsquo;s fortifications; the Gridhakuta (Vulture&rsquo;s Peak), where the Buddha delivered many important sermons; the Saptaparni Cave, where the first Buddhist council was held; the Venu Vana, a bamboo grove gifted to the Buddha by King Bimbisara; and the Ajatashatru Fort, built by Ajatashatru, Bimbisara’s son.</p>
