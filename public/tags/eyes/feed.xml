She is a manifestation of Goddess Sati, and her association stems from the legend surrounding the fall of Sati&amp;rsquo;s eyes at the site where her principal temple now stands. Naina Devi is considered a powerful protectress and bestower of boons, embodying the fierce and compassionate aspects of the divine feminine (Shakti). Her devotees seek her blessings for protection, prosperity, and fulfillment of desires. Her iconography primarily centers around the eyes, symbolizing her all-seeing nature and her ability to perceive the needs of her devotees. Naina Devi holds significant importance in Hinduism, representing the power of Shakti and the sacredness of specific locations connected to the divine.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
