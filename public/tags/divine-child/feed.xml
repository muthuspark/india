He is revered as the commander-in-chief of the celestial army, embodying courage, youthfulness, and wisdom. Subrahmanya represents the power to overcome obstacles and attain spiritual enlightenment. His key attributes include his vel (spear), representing divine power, and his peacock mount, symbolizing victory over ego and worldly desires. He holds significant importance within Hinduism, particularly in the Shaivite tradition, as the son of Shiva and Parvati.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
