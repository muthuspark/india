&lt;h3 id="introduction"&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vishwakarma, also known as the divine architect and craftsman, occupies a significant position in the Hindu pantheon. He is revered as the master of all crafts and the builder of the palaces of the gods. Depicted as a skilled artisan, he is often credited with creating the weapons, tools, and infrastructure used by both gods and demons. His association with creation, innovation, and craftsmanship makes him a particularly important deity for artisans, engineers, and architects.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
