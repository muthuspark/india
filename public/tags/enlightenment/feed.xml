&lt;h3 id="introduction"&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In certain traditions of Hinduism, particularly Vaishnavism, Buddha is considered an avatar (incarnation) of the Hindu god Vishnu, one of the principal deities of the Hindu trinity (Trimurti). While the historical figure Siddhartha Gautama, the founder of Buddhism, is central to Buddhist philosophy and practice, the Hindu understanding views Buddha as a strategic avatar of Vishnu sent to Earth for specific purposes. Key attributes associated with Buddha as an avatar of Vishnu include compassion, wisdom, and a focus on ethical conduct. His iconography in Hindu contexts is often a recognizable depiction of the meditating Buddha figure. The significance of Buddha as an avatar lies in his role within the cyclical narratives of Hindu cosmology and his perceived impact on societal and religious developments.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Buddha Purnima</title><link>https://india.muthu.co/posts/festivals/buddha-purnima/</link><pubDate>Sun, 01 Dec 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://india.muthu.co/posts/festivals/buddha-purnima/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="buddha-purnima-illuminating-the-world-with-peace-and-compassion"&gt;Buddha Purnima: Illuminating the World with Peace and Compassion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Have you ever felt a wave of serenity wash over you just by witnessing a flickering candle or hearing the gentle chant of a mantra? That&amp;rsquo;s the kind of profound peace that permeates the air during Buddha Purnima, one of the most significant festivals in Buddhism and a truly special occasion in India. It&amp;rsquo;s a day where the world pauses to remember the birth, enlightenment, and death of Gautama Buddha, the founder of Buddhism, a man whose teachings continue to inspire millions across the globe. More than just a religious observance, Buddha Purnima is a celebration of peace, compassion, and the unwavering pursuit of inner wisdom. Imagine streets adorned with colourful prayer flags fluttering in the breeze, the aroma of incense wafting from temples, and the collective hum of devotees chanting Buddhist scriptures. It&amp;rsquo;s a sensory feast that speaks directly to the soul.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Diwali (Jainism)</title><link>https://india.muthu.co/posts/festivals/diwali-jainism/</link><pubDate>Sun, 01 Dec 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://india.muthu.co/posts/festivals/diwali-jainism/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="beyond-the-lights-a-spiritual-awakening-with-jain-diwali"&gt;Beyond the Lights: A Spiritual Awakening with Jain Diwali&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Diwali, the Festival of Lights, is a name synonymous with dazzling displays of fireworks, the warm glow of diyas (oil lamps), and the sweetness of mithai (Indian sweets). But there&amp;rsquo;s a lesser-known, equally profound dimension to this festival, one that resonates with a quiet, inner radiance: Jain Diwali. While the rest of India celebrates the return of Lord Rama to Ayodhya, the Jain community marks this day as the nirvana kalyanak, the day Lord Mahavira, the 24th and last Tirthankara (spiritual teacher) of this era, attained moksha – liberation from the cycle of birth and death. For Jains, Diwali is a time for deep introspection, spiritual renewal, and a celebration of the victory of the soul over karmic bondage. It&amp;rsquo;s a day to dim the external lights and illuminate the inner self.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
