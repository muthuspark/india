      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;swaminarayan-a-modern-deity-in-hinduism&#34;&gt;Swaminarayan: A Modern Deity in Hinduism&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;h3 id=&#34;introduction&#34;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Swaminarayan, also known as Sahajanand Swami, is a prominent figure in modern Hinduism, revered by his followers as a manifestation of God (Bhagwan). While not a deity featured in ancient Hindu scriptures, Swaminarayan occupies a significant position within the Swaminarayan Sampradaya, a Vaishnava Hindu denomination. He is recognized for his teachings on devotion, ethics, and social reform, particularly in the 19th century in Gujarat, India. His key attributes include compassion, wisdom, and spiritual authority. Iconographically, he is often depicted in saffron robes, holding a rosary and seated in a meditative posture. His significance lies in his establishment of a vibrant religious movement that emphasizes moral purity, selfless service, and the pursuit of spiritual enlightenment through bhakti (devotion).&lt;/p&gt;</description>
