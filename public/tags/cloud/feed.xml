&lt;h3 id="introduction"&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Saranyu (Sanskrit: सरण्यू, IAST: &lt;em&gt;Saraṇyū&lt;/em&gt;), also known as Sanjna, is a prominent goddess in Hindu mythology. Primarily identified as the goddess of clouds, she is best known as the consort of Surya, the Sun God, and the mother of Yama (the god of death) and Yami (the goddess associated with rivers and twins). Her story, a tale of wifely duty, divine deception, and the origins of horses, features prominently in early Vedic literature. Saranyu is significant as a representation of feminine power, cosmic balance, and the complex relationship between mortals and the divine. Her role as the mother of Yama links her directly to concepts of mortality and judgment, key components of Hindu cosmology.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
