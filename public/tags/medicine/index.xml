      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;dhanvantari-the-divine-physician-and-god-of-ayurveda&#34;&gt;Dhanvantari: The Divine Physician and God of Ayurveda&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;h3 id=&#34;introduction&#34;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Dhanvantari is a revered Hindu deity and an avatar of Vishnu, primarily recognized as the god of Ayurveda, the traditional Indian system of medicine. He is considered the divine physician who emerged during the churning of the cosmic ocean (Samudra Manthana), carrying the nectar of immortality (Amrita). Dhanvantari embodies the principles of healing, health, and longevity, and is deeply venerated by practitioners of Ayurveda and those seeking physical and spiritual well-being. His iconography typically depicts him as a handsome figure holding a pot of Amrita, symbolizing the power to alleviate suffering and grant eternal life. Dhanvantari&amp;rsquo;s significance in Hinduism lies in his role as the upholder of health and the dispeller of disease, representing a divine force dedicated to the welfare of humanity.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
