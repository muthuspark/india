      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;yamadharmaraja-the-upholder-of-cosmic-law-in-hinduism&#34;&gt;Yamadharmaraja: The Upholder of Cosmic Law in Hinduism&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;h3 id=&#34;introduction&#34;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Yamadharmaraja, often simply referred to as Yama, is a prominent deity in Hinduism, revered as the god of death and justice. His complete title emphasizes his profound role as the upholder of Dharma, the cosmic law that governs the universe. Yama is not merely a bringer of death; he is a righteous judge, responsible for assessing the karmic merit of individuals and determining their subsequent fate in the afterlife. Typically depicted with dark skin, red garments, and a buffalo mount, Yama holds a noose (pasha) to capture souls and a mace (danda) to punish the wicked. His significance lies in reminding individuals of the impermanence of life, the importance of ethical conduct, and the consequences of their actions. He represents the cyclical nature of existence and the ultimate accountability that everyone faces.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
