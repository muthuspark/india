      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;jalaram-a-19th-century-saint-deity-of-gujarat&#34;&gt;Jalaram: A 19th-Century Saint-Deity of Gujarat&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;h3 id=&#34;introduction&#34;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Jalaram Bapa (1799-1881), a revered figure primarily worshipped in Gujarat, India, is a unique and relatively modern addition to the pantheon of Hindu deities. He is not mentioned in ancient scriptures like the Vedas or Puranas, distinguishing him from traditionally recognized gods and goddesses. Instead, Jalaram&amp;rsquo;s divinity stems from his extraordinary life of selfless service, particularly his unwavering commitment to feeding the hungry, irrespective of caste, creed, or religion. He is often depicted as a compassionate and humble figure, embodying the ideals of charity, devotion, and selfless action. His iconography typically includes a walking stick (Danda), a bowl for alms (Kamandalu), and often, a picture of his Guru, Bhoja Bhagat. Jalaram&amp;rsquo;s significance lies in his representation of the principles of Karma Yoga and the accessibility of divinity through virtuous living, offering a contemporary model for devotion and social responsibility within Hinduism.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
