      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;jumadi-a-regional-guardian-spirit-of-south-india&#34;&gt;Jumadi: A Regional Guardian Spirit of South India&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;h3 id=&#34;introduction&#34;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Jumadi is a regional guardian deity primarily worshipped in the Tulu Nadu region of South India, encompassing parts of Karnataka and Kerala. Often classified as a Bhuta Kola, Jumadi represents a powerful spirit that acts as a protector of villages, fields, and communities. Jumadi is not considered a part of the orthodox Hindu pantheon and is usually categorized within the sphere of animistic and shamanistic folk traditions that predate or coexist with mainstream Hinduism. Key attributes associated with Jumadi include fierce protection, justice dispensation, and control over natural forces. Iconographically, Jumadi is represented in various forms, often fearsome, with characteristic attire and ornaments. While not directly mentioned in classical Hindu scriptures, Jumadi plays a significant role in the religious and social fabric of Tulu Nadu, demonstrating the dynamism and syncretism inherent within Hinduism&amp;rsquo;s broader umbrella.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
