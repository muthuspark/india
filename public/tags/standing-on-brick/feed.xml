&lt;h3 id="introduction"&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vithoba, also known as Vitthal or Panduranga, is a Hindu deity predominantly worshipped in the Indian state of Maharashtra. Considered a manifestation of Krishna or Vishnu, he stands as a central figure in the Varkari tradition of Hinduism, a devotional movement emphasizing Bhakti (devotion) and egalitarianism. Vithoba is often depicted as a dark-complexioned youth standing arms akimbo on a brick, embodying compassion, accessibility, and a divine presence immanent within the devotee&amp;rsquo;s heart. His worship is deeply rooted in the cultural and spiritual landscape of Maharashtra, transcending caste and social barriers.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
