      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;ayyappan-the-divine-offspring-of-shiva-and-vishnu&#34;&gt;Ayyappan: The Divine Offspring of Shiva and Vishnu&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;h3 id=&#34;introduction&#34;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Ayyappan, also known as Dharma Sasta, is a Hindu deity primarily worshipped in South India, particularly in Kerala. He is revered as the offspring of Lord Shiva and Vishnu in his female form of Mohini. Typically depicted in a yogic posture, Ayyappan represents the harmonious union of Shaivism and Vaishnavism, two major Hindu traditions. His worship is associated with principles of dharma, self-discipline, and devotion, and the pilgrimage to his principal shrine at Sabarimala is one of the largest annual pilgrimages in the world. Ayyappan&amp;rsquo;s significance in Hinduism lies in his role as a protector, a mediator, and a symbol of interfaith harmony.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

He is revered as the embodiment of dharma (righteousness) and is often depicted as a celibate yogi, a warrior, or a divine child. Dharma Shasta is unique in Hinduism due to his origin â€“ he is believed to be the son of Shiva and Mohini, the female avatar of Vishnu. His worship is characterized by intricate pilgrimages, strict vows, and the chanting of devotional hymns. Understanding Dharma Shasta offers valuable insights into the syncretic nature of Hindu belief and the importance of dharma in spiritual pursuits.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
