&lt;h3 id="introduction"&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tara, also known as Tārā (तारा), is a significant Hindu goddess revered primarily for her roles in protection, guidance, and compassion. Though more prominently featured in Vajrayana Buddhism, Tara also holds a respected position in Hinduism, particularly within Shaktism. She is often invoked for overcoming obstacles, granting wishes, and leading devotees towards enlightenment. Tara&amp;rsquo;s iconography typically depicts her as a compassionate figure, embodying nurturing and supportive qualities. Her significance in Hinduism, although lesser known than some other goddesses, stems from her powerful connection to wisdom, deliverance, and the alleviation of suffering.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
