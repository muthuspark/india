      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;nandi-the-sacred-bull-of-shiva&#34;&gt;Nandi: The Sacred Bull of Shiva&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;** Introduction**&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Nandi, the sacred bull, is a central figure in Hinduism, revered as the vahana (mount) and principal gatekeeper of Lord Shiva. Represented as a white bull, often depicted reclining and facing the inner sanctum of Shiva temples, Nandi embodies strength, devotion, and righteousness. He is more than just a vehicle; Nandi is considered a devotee and eternal companion of Shiva, symbolizing the perfect disciple and the embodiment of dharma. His presence is considered auspicious, and his image is a ubiquitous feature in Shiva temples throughout the Indian subcontinent and beyond.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
