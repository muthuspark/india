      <description>&lt;h3 id=&#34;introduction&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Introduction&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Sundarbans National Park, a UNESCO World Heritage site, stands as a testament to the raw, untamed beauty of the Bengal Delta. Located in the South 24 Parganas district of West Bengal, India, this mangrove forest forms part of the larger Sundarbans delta shared with Bangladesh. The park, approximately 100 kilometers south of Kolkata, is characterized by its dense mangrove forests, crisscrossed by a network of tidal waterways. Its low elevation (close to sea level) and proximity to the Bay of Bengal make it a unique and dynamic ecosystem. The Sundarbans is primarily known as the home of the Royal Bengal Tiger, but it boasts a remarkable biodiversity of flora and fauna, making it a vital conservation area and a captivating destination for nature enthusiasts.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
