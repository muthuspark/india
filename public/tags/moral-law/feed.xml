&lt;h3 id="introduction"&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dharma, often translated as righteousness, duty, or cosmic order, is a central concept in Hinduism and also personified as a deity. He embodies the principles of morality, law, and order that uphold the universe. As a god, Dharma represents the ideal conduct and righteous path that individuals should strive to follow. His influence extends beyond individual behavior to encompass societal harmony and the proper functioning of the cosmos.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
