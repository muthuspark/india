She is primarily known as the slayer of the buffalo-demon Mahishasura, embodying the triumph of good over evil, and divine feminine power (Shakti). Iconographically, she is depicted as a warrior goddess riding a lion or tiger, wielding an array of weapons and engaging in combat with the demon Mahishasura. Her significance lies in her ability to restore cosmic balance, protect devotees, and represent the potential for overcoming adversity within oneself.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
