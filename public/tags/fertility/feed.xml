&lt;p&gt;Parvati, the Hindu goddess of love, fertility, devotion, and divine strength, is widely revered as the consort of Lord Shiva and the mother of Ganesha and Kartikeya (Skanda).

Iconographically, Parvati is often depicted as a beautiful woman with a benevolent expression, adorned with traditional Indian jewelry and clothing. She is a central figure in the Hindu pantheon, symbolizing marital harmony, motherhood, and the power of feminine energy in achieving spiritual liberation. Parvati&amp;rsquo;s significance lies not only in her role as Shiva&amp;rsquo;s consort but also in her independent power and the myriad forms she assumes to protect devotees and uphold dharma.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Rohini Nakshatram</title><link>https://india.muthu.co/posts/gods/rohini-nakshatram/</link><pubDate>Sun, 01 Dec 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://india.muthu.co/posts/gods/rohini-nakshatram/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="rohini-nakshatram-star-goddess-and-consort-of-chandra"&gt;Rohini Nakshatram: Star Goddess and Consort of Chandra&lt;/h2&gt;
