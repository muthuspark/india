She embodies the feminine principle (Shakti) and is considered the complete manifestation of Adi Shakti, the primordial cosmic energy.

Parvati&amp;rsquo;s significance lies not only in her role as Shiva&amp;rsquo;s consort but also in her independent power and the myriad forms she assumes to protect devotees and uphold dharma.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
