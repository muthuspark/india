Welcome to Jitiya, a vibrant and emotionally charged festival celebrated primarily in Bihar, Jharkhand, and parts of Nepal. It’s a testament to the powerful bond between a mother and her child, a celebration of fertility, protection, and the enduring strength of maternal love.

I remember growing up watching my own mother observe this fast. The determination etched on her face, the quiet prayers whispered under her breath – it left an indelible impression on me, a testament to a mother’s relentless dedication. Jitiya is more than just a festival; it’s a living embodiment of a mother’s love, passed down through generations like a cherished heirloom.
