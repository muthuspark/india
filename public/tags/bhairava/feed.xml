&lt;h3 id="introduction"&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vatuka Bhairava, also known as Batuk Bhairav, is a significant deity within the Hindu pantheon, particularly revered in Tantric traditions. He is a youthful and benevolent form of Bhairava, an aspect of Lord Shiva associated with destruction, protection, and liberation. While Bhairava is often depicted as fearsome and formidable, Vatuka Bhairava represents his more accessible and compassionate side, acting as a protector of children, a grantor of wishes, and a remover of obstacles. His iconography generally portrays him as a young boy, often naked or lightly clad, radiating a sense of innocence and purity. Vatuka Bhairava’s significance lies in his ability to offer both worldly benefits (bhukti) and spiritual liberation (mukti) to his devotees.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
