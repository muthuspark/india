&lt;p&gt;Budha, also known as Saumya, is the Hindu god associated with the planet Mercury. He is regarded as the deity of wit, intelligence, commerce, and communication.

He is venerated as one of the nine Navagrahas (nine celestial bodies) in Hindu astrology and is believed to have a significant impact on one&amp;rsquo;s life based on his position in the birth chart.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
