      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;vayu-the-hindu-god-of-wind&#34;&gt;Vayu: The Hindu God of Wind&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;h3 id=&#34;introduction&#34;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Vayu, also known as Pavana, is the Hindu deity of wind and air. He is a vital element in the Hindu cosmology, representing the breath of life and the force that permeates the universe. Vayu is not merely the atmospheric phenomenon but a powerful cosmic being responsible for the movement and vitality of all things. He is considered one of the five elements (Panchabhuta) – earth, water, fire, air, and space – that constitute the physical world. Vayu plays a significant role in the scriptures and is venerated for his strength, speed, and essential role in sustaining life. Iconographically, he is often depicted as a powerful figure, sometimes riding a deer or chariot, symbolizing his swiftness and control over the winds. His significance in Hinduism lies in his life-giving power, his role as a cosmic regulator, and his close associations with other prominent deities.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
