      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;aditi-the-boundless-mother-of-the-gods&#34;&gt;Aditi: The Boundless Mother of the Gods&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;h3 id=&#34;introduction&#34;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Aditi, a prominent figure in Hinduism, is revered as the mother of the Devas (gods). Representing boundlessness, freedom, and cosmic space, she embodies the infinite and primordial substance from which the universe and its deities emerged. Her key attribute is her role as the divine mother, providing nurture and protection to her offspring. While not typically depicted with specific iconography in the same way as other major deities, her presence is felt in the reverence for motherhood and the expansive nature of the cosmos. Aditi&amp;rsquo;s significance in Hinduism lies in her representation of the source of all existence, the boundless potential from which creation springs forth.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
