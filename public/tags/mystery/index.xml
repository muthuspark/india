      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;yamini-goddess-of-night-and-darkness-in-hinduism&#34;&gt;Yamini: Goddess of Night and Darkness in Hinduism&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;** Introduction**&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Yamini, in Hindu tradition, is a goddess who embodies the essence of night and darkness. Often viewed as a powerful and mysterious figure, she represents the stillness, introspection, and transformative potential associated with the night. While not as widely worshipped as some of the major Hindu deities, Yamini holds a significant position as a personification of the natural cycle and a symbol of the unseen forces that govern the world. She is often seen as a counterpart to deities representing light and day, completing the cosmic balance. Her iconography and significance vary across different Hindu texts and traditions, but she consistently embodies the profound aspects of the night.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
