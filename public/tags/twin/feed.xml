      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;yami-goddess-of-the-yamuna-and-sister-of-yama&#34;&gt;Yami: Goddess of the Yamuna and Sister of Yama&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;h3 id=&#34;introduction&#34;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Yami, a significant yet often overlooked deity in Hinduism, is primarily known as the goddess of the Yamuna River (also known as the Jamuna). She is also revered as the sister of Yama, the god of death and the underworld. While Yama is often associated with fear and finality, Yami represents life, nurturing, and the life-sustaining power of the river. She embodies the vital connection between life and death, purification and renewal, and divine siblinghood. Her presence is a reminder of the cyclical nature of existence and the importance of reverence for natural forces.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
