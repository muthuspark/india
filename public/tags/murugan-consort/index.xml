      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;valli-consort-of-murugan-and-tribal-princess&#34;&gt;Valli: Consort of Murugan and Tribal Princess&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;h3 id=&#34;introduction&#34;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Valli, also known as Valliammai, is a Hindu goddess revered as the consort of Lord Murugan (also known as Kartikeya, Skanda, Subramanya). She is often depicted as a young, beautiful tribal princess who represents the earthiness and rustic simplicity that complements Murugan&amp;rsquo;s divine warrior nature. Valli&amp;rsquo;s story emphasizes the power of devotion, love, and the integration of different social strata into the broader Hindu fold. She is an integral part of Murugan worship, particularly in South India and Sri Lanka, where her temples and stories abound. Her key attribute is her unwavering devotion to Murugan, and her iconography typically portrays her as a graceful woman adorned in simple tribal attire, often alongside her consort. Her significance lies in her representation of the power of pure, unconditional love, and her role in harmonizing divine and earthly realms.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
