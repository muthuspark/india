&lt;h3 id="introduction"&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yoganidra, the &amp;ldquo;Sleep of Yoga,&amp;rdquo; is a significant aspect of the Hindu Goddess Shakti. She represents the cosmic sleep that sustains the universe between cycles of creation and dissolution. She is not simply dormancy but a state of conscious awareness and potent creative energy, the backdrop against which the manifested world plays out. Often depicted as reclining or resting, Yoganidra is understood to be a powerful force that both lulls the universe into slumber and awakens it anew.
