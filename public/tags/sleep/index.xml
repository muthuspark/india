      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;yoganidra-the-goddess-of-cosmic-sleep-in-hinduism&#34;&gt;Yoganidra: The Goddess of Cosmic Sleep in Hinduism&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;h3 id=&#34;introduction&#34;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Yoganidra, the &amp;ldquo;Sleep of Yoga,&amp;rdquo; is a significant aspect of the Hindu Goddess Shakti. She represents the cosmic sleep that sustains the universe between cycles of creation and dissolution. She is not simply dormancy but a state of conscious awareness and potent creative energy, the backdrop against which the manifested world plays out. Often depicted as reclining or resting, Yoganidra is understood to be a powerful force that both lulls the universe into slumber and awakens it anew. As a manifestation of Devi, the divine feminine principle, Yoganidra embodies the potential for creation and transformation. Her significance lies in her ability to facilitate profound inner experiences and ultimately, the realization of union with the divine.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
