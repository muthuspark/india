&lt;h3 id="introduction"&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kalki is the prophesied tenth and final avatar (incarnation) of Vishnu, the preserver god in the Hindu Trimurti (trinity). He is foretold to appear at the end of Kali Yuga, the current epoch, which is characterized by moral decay and societal breakdown. Kalki is depicted as a warrior riding a white horse, brandishing a blazing sword, and is destined to restore dharma (righteousness) and usher in a new Satya Yuga (age of truth). While not as widely worshipped as some other Vishnu avatars like Rama and Krishna, Kalki holds significant importance in Hindu eschatology and symbolizes the cyclical nature of time and the inevitable triumph of good over evil.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
