&lt;h3 id="introduction"&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ranganatha is a prominent form of Vishnu, the preserver god in the Hindu Trinity (Trimurti). Characterized by his reclining posture (Anantasayana), Ranganatha is predominantly venerated in South India, particularly in the state of Tamil Nadu. He is a central deity in the Sri Vaishnava tradition, a major denomination of Vaishnavism. Ranganatha signifies Vishnu&amp;rsquo;s role as the cosmic sovereign, resting on the serpent Adisesha, the embodiment of eternity, and representing the cyclical nature of creation, preservation, and dissolution. His iconography is rich with symbolism, and his worship is deeply integrated into the cultural and religious fabric of South India.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
