      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;chitragupta-the-divine-accountant-of-karma&#34;&gt;Chitragupta: The Divine Accountant of Karma&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;h3 id=&#34;introduction&#34;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Chitragupta, a prominent deity in Hinduism, is revered as the keeper of records for all human actions. His primary function is to meticulously document the good and bad deeds (karma) of every individual and, after death, determine their fate in the afterlife. He is often depicted as a divine scribe, holding a pen, inkpot, and ledger, symbolizing his role in recording and assessing the karmic consequences of human lives. Chitragupta&amp;rsquo;s significance lies in his association with dharma (righteousness), karma (action), and moksha (liberation), highlighting the Hindu belief in the law of cause and effect and the importance of living a virtuous life.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
