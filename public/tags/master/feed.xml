&lt;h3 id="introduction"&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yogeshvara, meaning &amp;ldquo;Lord of Yoga,&amp;rdquo; is a significant aspect of Shiva within Hinduism, particularly revered as the supreme master of yoga, meditation, and spiritual discipline. This form of Shiva embodies the ultimate goal of yoga – the union of the individual soul (Atman) with the universal consciousness (Brahman). Yogeshvara represents the power of introspection, self-control, and transcendence, offering devotees a path towards liberation (moksha) through rigorous spiritual practice. He is often depicted in meditative postures, signifying the stillness and focus required for inner realization. The worship of Yogeshvara emphasizes the practical application of yogic principles in daily life, leading to physical, mental, and spiritual well-being.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
