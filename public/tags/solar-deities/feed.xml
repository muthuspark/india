&lt;h3 id="introduction"&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Adityas are a group of solar deities in Hinduism, revered as the children of Aditi, the goddess of infinity and boundlessness. They are primarily associated with the sun and its various aspects, representing qualities such as brilliance, power, light, and the maintenance of cosmic order (Dharma). While their number and specific identities vary across different Vedic and Puranic texts, they are generally seen as benevolent protectors of the world, upholding justice and dispelling darkness. Their significance lies in their connection to the life-giving energy of the sun, which is fundamental to existence on Earth.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
