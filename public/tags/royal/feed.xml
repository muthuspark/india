&lt;h3 id="introduction"&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bhishma, also known as Pitamaha Bhishma (Grandfather Bhishma), is one of the most revered and complex characters in the Hindu epic, the Mahabharata. He is celebrated for his unwavering commitment to dharma (righteousness), his formidable martial prowess, and, most significantly, his solemn vow of celibacy, which ultimately shaped the course of the epic. Though not typically considered a deity in the same vein as Vishnu or Shiva, Bhishma is often regarded as a divine figure owing to his extraordinary virtues and the circumstances of his birth. His key attributes are his wisdom, strength, self-sacrifice, and devotion to the Kuru dynasty. Iconographically, he is often depicted as a wise, elderly warrior, clad in armor and lying on a bed of arrows. Bhishma’s significance in Hinduism lies in his embodiment of duty, honor, and the consequences of one&amp;rsquo;s choices, serving as a moral compass throughout the epic.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
