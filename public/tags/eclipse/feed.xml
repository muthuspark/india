&lt;h3 id="introduction"&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rahu is a significant celestial entity in Hinduism, categorized as one of the &lt;em&gt;Navagrahas&lt;/em&gt; (nine planets). Unlike other planets that represent physical celestial bodies, Rahu is a shadow planet, representing the north lunar node, the point where the Moon&amp;rsquo;s orbit crosses the ecliptic. Rahu is a powerful force, often associated with eclipses, chaos, confusion, ambition, and worldly desires. Iconographically, Rahu is typically depicted as a serpent&amp;rsquo;s head with no body, often riding a lion or black horse. His presence is considered to have a profound impact on astrological charts and is often viewed with a degree of apprehension due to its association with karmic debts and challenging life events. Rahu&amp;rsquo;s significance lies in its ability to obfuscate and influence human perception, pushing individuals towards material pursuits and questioning established norms.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
