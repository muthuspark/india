&lt;h3 id="introduction"&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gusainji, also known as Shri Vitthalnathji, is a central figure in the Pushti Marg tradition of Vaishnavism, a devotional school within Hinduism that emphasizes grace and love as the primary paths to spiritual liberation. Gusainji is revered as the son of Shri Vallabhacharya, the founder of Pushti Marg, and as an incarnation (avatar) of Shri Krishna himself. He played a pivotal role in systematizing and expanding the Pushti Marg philosophy and practices. He is not typically depicted with specific iconography distinct from Krishna but is understood as a manifestation of Krishna&amp;rsquo;s grace and divine presence. His significance lies in his role as a guru (spiritual teacher) and a key figure in the lineage and development of the Pushti Marg.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
