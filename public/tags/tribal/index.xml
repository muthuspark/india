She is often depicted as a young, beautiful tribal princess who represents the earthiness and rustic simplicity that complements Murugan&amp;rsquo;s divine warrior nature. Valli&amp;rsquo;s story emphasizes the power of devotion, love, and the integration of different social strata into the broader Hindu fold. She is an integral part of Murugan worship, particularly in South India and Sri Lanka, where her temples and stories abound. Her key attribute is her unwavering devotion to Murugan, and her iconography typically portrays her as a graceful woman adorned in simple tribal attire, often alongside her consort. Her significance lies in her representation of the power of pure, unconditional love, and her role in harmonizing divine and earthly realms.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;waghoba-the-tiger-god-of-maharashtras-tribal-communities&#34;&gt;Waghoba: The Tiger God of Maharashtra&amp;rsquo;s Tribal Communities&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;h3 id=&#34;introduction&#34;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Waghoba, also known as Vyaghra Deva, is a tiger deity revered primarily by tribal communities in the Indian state of Maharashtra and surrounding regions. He is a significant figure in the local animistic traditions, representing the potent power of nature and the importance of respecting the delicate balance between humans and the environment. While not typically found within the mainstream Hindu pantheon with elaborate scriptures and established doctrines, Waghoba&amp;rsquo;s worship is deeply ingrained in the cultural fabric of these communities, reflecting their close relationship with the forests and the animals that inhabit them. His key attributes include strength, protection, and the embodiment of the wild. Iconographically, he is often represented by a simple stone or a rudimentary image depicting a tiger, embodying the essence of the majestic predator. Waghoba&amp;rsquo;s significance in Hinduism, particularly within the context of folk and tribal traditions, lies in his representation of the forces of nature that must be respected and appeased for the well-being of the community.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
