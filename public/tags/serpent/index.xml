She embodies the potent connection between the natural world, particularly trees, fertility, and the serpentine realm.

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;vasugi-the-serpent-goddess-of-hindu-tradition&#34;&gt;Vasugi: The Serpent Goddess of Hindu Tradition&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;h3 id=&#34;introduction&#34;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Vasugi, often referred to as the female counterpart of the serpent king Vasuki, is a significant, albeit less prominently documented, serpent goddess in Hinduism. While Vasuki is widely known for his role in the churning of the ocean (Samudra Manthan), Vasugi&amp;rsquo;s presence complements his, representing the feminine energy associated with serpents, creation, and cosmic balance. She is often associated with fertility, protection, and the cyclical nature of life and death. Though not as extensively detailed in scriptures as other major goddesses, her existence is acknowledged and implied through the presence and significance of female Nagas and Naga Kanyas (serpent maidens) within Hindu mythology. Her iconography is varied but generally depicts her as a beautiful woman with serpentine features, often adorned with jewels and associated with water bodies.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
