      <description>&lt;p&gt;Rameshvaram is a sacred island located off the southeastern coast of Tamil Nadu, India. Its name literally means &amp;ldquo;Rama the god,&amp;rdquo; reflecting its profound religious significance in Hindu tradition. This island is considered one of the holiest pilgrimage destinations in India, holding immense spiritual importance for devotees.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;mythological-significance&#34;&gt;Mythological Significance&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;According to the epic Ramayana, Lord Rama stopped at Rameshvaram to purify himself after defeating and killing the demon king Ravana. This act of purification was essential for Rama, as killing Ravana (who was a Brahmin by birth) required ritual cleansing.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
