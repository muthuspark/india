&lt;h3 id="introduction"&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tripura Sundari, also known as Shodashi, Lalita, or Rajarajeshwari, is a prominent Hindu goddess revered as one of the ten Mahavidyas – the Wisdom Goddesses representing different aspects of the Divine Feminine. She embodies supreme beauty, power, and grace, and is considered the most beautiful goddess in the three worlds (Tripura: &lt;em&gt;tri&lt;/em&gt; meaning three, &lt;em&gt;pura&lt;/em&gt; meaning city or world). Her iconography typically depicts her as a radiant and youthful sixteen-year-old, embodying eternal beauty and perfection. As the ultimate embodiment of Shakti, she is crucial to Shaktism, the Hindu tradition focused on the worship of the Divine Feminine. Tripura Sundari represents the supreme consciousness and the inherent beauty and bliss within creation. Her worship aims at realizing the inherent divinity within oneself and the universe.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
