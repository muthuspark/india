&lt;h3 id="introduction"&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Varuna is a prominent Hindu deity initially revered as a sovereign of cosmic order, law, and justice, and later primarily associated with the waters, oceans, rivers, and aquatic creatures. He holds a significant position within the Hindu pantheon, particularly in the early Vedic period, where he is considered one of the most important Adityas, a group of solar deities. Varuna embodies both the creative and regulatory aspects of the cosmos, enforcing moral and ritual order while overseeing the vastness of the oceans and waterways. His iconography often depicts him as a regal figure, seated on a Makara (a mythical aquatic creature) or a throne, symbolizing his dominion over the watery realms. While his prominence waned in later Hindu traditions, Varuna remains a crucial figure in understanding the evolution of Hindu cosmology and ethics.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
