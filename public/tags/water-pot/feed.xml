      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;renuka-the-embodiment-of-devotion-and-sacrifice&#34;&gt;Renuka: The Embodiment of Devotion and Sacrifice&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;h3 id=&#34;introduction&#34;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Renuka is a revered Hindu goddess, primarily known as the wife of the sage Jamadagni and the mother of Parashurama, the sixth avatar of Vishnu. She is celebrated for her unwavering devotion (pativrata dharma), her profound connection to nature, and the tragic events that defined her life and ultimately led to her deification. Her story, characterized by obedience, loss, and ultimate redemption, holds significant symbolic meaning for devotees. Renuka’s influence is particularly strong in Maharashtra, Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, and Telangana, where she is worshipped as a powerful and benevolent goddess.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
