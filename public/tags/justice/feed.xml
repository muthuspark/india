He is neither inherently benevolent nor malevolent, but rather a force of cosmic balance, rewarding righteous actions and punishing wrongdoing. His key attributes include a slow pace (Śanaiścara literally means &amp;ldquo;slow-moving&amp;rdquo;), discipline, austerity, and profound wisdom born of experience. Iconographically, Shani is often depicted as dark in complexion, adorned with black clothing, and riding a crow or buffalo. In Hinduism, Shani holds significant importance as a judge of moral behavior and a facilitator of spiritual growth through karmic retribution.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Yama</title><link>https://india.muthu.co/posts/gods/yama/</link><pubDate>Sun, 01 Dec 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://india.muthu.co/posts/gods/yama/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="yama-the-lord-of-death-and-justice-in-hindu-cosmology"&gt;Yama: The Lord of Death and Justice in Hindu Cosmology&lt;/h2&gt;

He holds a prominent and multifaceted role in Hindu cosmology, serving as the judge of the departed souls and the guardian of the southern direction (Dakshina). While often associated with fear and the end of life, Yama&amp;rsquo;s position is crucial for maintaining cosmic order and upholding the principles of karma and dharma. He ensures that every soul receives its due consequences based on its actions in life, ultimately guiding them towards the cycle of rebirth and the possibility of moksha (liberation).&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Yamadharmaraja</title><link>https://india.muthu.co/posts/gods/yamadharmaraja/</link><pubDate>Sun, 01 Dec 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://india.muthu.co/posts/gods/yamadharmaraja/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="yamadharmaraja-the-upholder-of-cosmic-law-in-hinduism"&gt;Yamadharmaraja: The Upholder of Cosmic Law in Hinduism&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="introduction"&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yamadharmaraja, often simply referred to as Yama, is a prominent deity in Hinduism, revered as the god of death and justice. His complete title emphasizes his profound role as the upholder of Dharma, the cosmic law that governs the universe. Yama is not merely a bringer of death; he is a righteous judge, responsible for assessing the karmic merit of individuals and determining their subsequent fate in the afterlife. Typically depicted with dark skin, red garments, and a buffalo mount, Yama holds a noose (pasha) to capture souls and a mace (danda) to punish the wicked.
