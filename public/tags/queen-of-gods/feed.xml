&lt;h3 id="introduction"&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indrani, also known as Shachi, is a prominent Hindu goddess and the consort of Indra, the king of the gods (Devas). She is revered as the queen of the celestial realm, Svarga, and embodies the ideal of a powerful and virtuous wife. Indrani represents conjugal bliss, strength, and prosperity, and plays a significant role in Hindu mythology and religious practices. While not always the primary focus of individual worship like some other deities, her presence and influence are pervasive in the stories and rituals concerning Indra.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
