      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;zarizari-a-folk-deity-of-coastal-protection&#34;&gt;Zarizari: A Folk Deity of Coastal Protection&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;h3 id=&#34;introduction&#34;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Zarizari is a regional Hindu folk deity primarily venerated in the coastal regions of India. Known predominantly as a protector against diseases, especially those affecting livestock and children, Zarizari occupies a unique space within the broader Hindu pantheon. Unlike deities found in the classical texts, Zarizari&amp;rsquo;s worship is rooted in local traditions and oral narratives, reflecting a more immediate and localized understanding of divine intervention and protection. Though specific iconography is not universally standardized, Zarizari is generally visualized as a powerful, protective figure, often associated with local materials and symbols representing health and prosperity. While not a prominent deity in mainstream Hinduism, Zarizari&amp;rsquo;s significance lies in providing comfort and security to communities facing health challenges, highlighting the adaptability and diversity of Hindu religious practices.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
