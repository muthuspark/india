      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;yamuna-the-sacred-river-goddess-of-hinduism&#34;&gt;Yamuna: The Sacred River Goddess of Hinduism&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;h3 id=&#34;introduction&#34;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Yamuna, also known as Jamuna, is a prominent goddess in Hinduism, revered as the personification of the Yamuna River, one of India&amp;rsquo;s most sacred waterways. As the daughter of the sun god Surya and twin sister of Yama, the god of death, Yamuna holds a significant position within the Hindu pantheon. She is venerated not just as a river, but as a divine being capable of bestowing blessings, purification, and ultimately, liberation. Yamuna is often depicted as a beautiful woman, usually dark complexioned, riding her mount, the tortoise, and holding a pot of water, symbolizing abundance and fertility. Her significance stems from her association with purity, immortality, and the holy city of Vrindavan, where Lord Krishna spent his childhood.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
