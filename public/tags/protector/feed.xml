&lt;h3 id="introduction"&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Narasimha (Sanskrit: नरसिंह, Narasiṁha), meaning &amp;ldquo;man-lion,&amp;rdquo; is a prominent avatar of the Hindu god Vishnu, revered for his fierce protection of his devotees. He is depicted as a hybrid being, possessing the body of a man and the head of a lion. This unique form embodies the concept of overcoming seemingly insurmountable obstacles and the divine triumph of good over evil. Narasimha&amp;rsquo;s key attributes include his immense strength, courage, and unwavering dedication to upholding dharma (righteousness). His iconography commonly features him tearing apart the demon Hiranyakashipu, symbolizing the destruction of negativity and the liberation of his devotee, Prahlada. Narasimha holds a significant place in Hinduism, particularly within Vaishnavism, where he is celebrated as a powerful and compassionate protector.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
