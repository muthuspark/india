&lt;h3 id="introduction"&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Garuda is a prominent deity in Hinduism, revered as the divine eagle mount (vahana) of the god Vishnu. He is primarily known for his immense strength, speed, and unwavering devotion to Vishnu, as well as his inherent enmity towards serpents (Nagas). Iconographically, Garuda is often depicted as a large, powerful bird-like creature, sometimes with human-like features, or as a fully human figure with avian characteristics like wings, beak, and claws. He is a symbol of courage, power, and protection against evil, and plays a significant role in Hindu mythology, cosmology, and religious practice. His image is frequently found adorning Vishnu temples, and he is considered an auspicious figure whose presence wards off negativity.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
