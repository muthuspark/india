      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;adimurti-the-primal-manifestation-of-vishnu&#34;&gt;Adimurti: The Primal Manifestation of Vishnu&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;h3 id=&#34;introduction&#34;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Adimurti (आदिमूर्ति), translating to &amp;ldquo;primordial form,&amp;rdquo; is a significant yet often lesser-known aspect of Vishnu within Hinduism. He represents the original, unmanifested form of Vishnu from which all subsequent avatars and manifestations arise. Adimurti embodies the eternal, unchanging essence of the divine, pre-dating creation itself. While not commonly worshipped in the same manner as avatars like Rama or Krishna, the concept of Adimurti holds deep philosophical importance, highlighting Vishnu&amp;rsquo;s timeless and omnipresent nature. Key attributes associated with Adimurti often include stillness, immanence, and the potential for all creation. Iconographically, he is often depicted in a meditative state, symbolizing the unmanifested potentiality of the universe.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
