      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;indra-king-of-the-gods-in-hindu-mythology&#34;&gt;Indra: King of the Gods in Hindu Mythology&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;** Introduction**&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Indra is a prominent deity in Hinduism, revered primarily as the King of the Devas (gods) and the lord of Svarga (heaven). He is particularly associated with rain, lightning, thunder, storms, and rivers. While his importance has somewhat diminished in modern Hinduism compared to the Trimurti (Brahma, Vishnu, Shiva) and their associated deities, Indra remains a crucial figure in the Vedic literature and continues to be recognized in various rituals and traditions.  His character is complex, embodying both strength and vulnerability, heroic deeds and moral failings.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

He is the son of Shiva and Parvati, and a significant figure in Hindu mythology, particularly in South India, Sri Lanka, and Southeast Asia. Kartikeya is typically depicted as a youthful warrior, often riding a peacock (his vahana or vehicle), wielding a spear (vel), and embodying courage, strength, and wisdom. He is venerated as a protector, a guide, and an embodiment of divine power. His significance in Hinduism extends beyond his role as a warrior; he is seen as a symbol of overcoming obstacles, achieving self-realization, and upholding dharma (righteousness).&lt;/p&gt;</description>
