&lt;p&gt;** Introduction**&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nandi, the sacred bull, is a central figure in Hinduism, revered as the vahana (mount) and principal gatekeeper of Lord Shiva. Represented as a white bull, often depicted reclining and facing the inner sanctum of Shiva temples, Nandi embodies strength, devotion, and righteousness. He is more than just a vehicle; Nandi is considered a devotee and eternal companion of Shiva, symbolizing the perfect disciple and the embodiment of dharma. His presence is considered auspicious, and his image is a ubiquitous feature in Shiva temples throughout the Indian subcontinent and beyond.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
