&lt;h3 id="introduction"&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aravan, also known as Iravat, is a complex and intriguing minor character derived from the epic Mahabharata. He is predominantly revered as a significant deity in the cult of Kuttantavar, particularly in Tamil Nadu, India. Though not a mainstream figure in pan-Indian Hindu traditions, Aravan’s significance lies in his unique sacrifice and association with transgender communities. His worship embodies themes of devotion, selflessness, and a complex understanding of dharma. While not typically depicted in traditional iconography outside of his cult following, representations often portray him with a severed head, symbolizing his ultimate sacrifice. In Hinduism, he represents a poignant reminder of the sacrifices made in the pursuit of victory and the nuances of duty.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
