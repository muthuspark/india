&lt;h3 id="introduction"&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beeralingeswara is a regional manifestation of the Hindu god Shiva, primarily revered as a fierce guardian deity in specific regions of India, particularly in parts of Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh. This form of Shiva embodies both the benevolent and terrifying aspects of the supreme god, providing protection to devotees while also upholding dharma. Unlike some pan-Indian forms of Shiva, Beeralingeswara’s iconography and worship are deeply rooted in local traditions and folklore, reflecting the unique cultural landscape where he is venerated. Key attributes include a fiery disposition, protective role, and association with justice and the suppression of evil. While considered a form of Shiva, his unique characteristics distinguish him within the broader Shaiva tradition.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
