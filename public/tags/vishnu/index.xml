      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;adimurti-the-primal-manifestation-of-vishnu&#34;&gt;Adimurti: The Primal Manifestation of Vishnu&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;h3 id=&#34;introduction&#34;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Adimurti (आदिमूर्ति), translating to &amp;ldquo;primordial form,&amp;rdquo; is a significant yet often lesser-known aspect of Vishnu within Hinduism. He represents the original, unmanifested form of Vishnu from which all subsequent avatars and manifestations arise.

Key attributes associated with Adimurti often include stillness, immanence, and the potential for all creation. Iconographically, he is often depicted in a meditative state, symbolizing the unmanifested potentiality of the universe.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
