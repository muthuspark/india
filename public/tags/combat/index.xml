      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;durga-the-invincible-goddess-of-power-and-protection&#34;&gt;Durga: The Invincible Goddess of Power and Protection&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;h3 id=&#34;introduction&#34;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Durga, meaning &amp;ldquo;the invincible&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;the inaccessible,&amp;rdquo; is a major deity in Hinduism, revered primarily as the warrior goddess who combats evil forces and restores dharma (righteousness). She is considered a fierce and powerful form of Parvati, the consort of Shiva, and embodies strength, motherhood, destruction, and protection. Durgaâ€™s iconography often depicts her as a multi-armed goddess riding a lion or tiger, wielding a variety of weapons to symbolize her ability to overcome any obstacle. Her worship is widespread, particularly during the festival of Durga Puja, and she is seen as a symbol of female power (Shakti) and the triumph of good over evil. In Hinduism, Durga&amp;rsquo;s significance lies in her role as the ultimate protector, capable of safeguarding devotees from all forms of adversity.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
