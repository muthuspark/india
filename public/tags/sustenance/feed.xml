&lt;h3 id="introduction"&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dhara is one of the eight Vasus, a group of attendant deities to Indra in early Vedic literature. These celestial beings are associated with various aspects of nature and cosmic order. Dhara, specifically, is closely connected to the Earth itself, representing its foundational stability and nurturing qualities. While not among the most widely worshipped deities in modern Hinduism, Dhara holds significant importance as a member of the Vasus and his role in sustaining life through the Earth. He is often depicted conceptually rather than iconographically, embodying the very essence of the terrestrial realm. His significance lies in his representation of the essential element of earth, which provides sustenance and stability to all beings.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
