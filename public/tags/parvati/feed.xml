      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;ardhanarishvara-the-androgynous-union-of-shiva-and-shakti&#34;&gt;Ardhanarishvara: The Androgynous Union of Shiva and Shakti&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;h3 id=&#34;introduction&#34;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Ardhanarishvara (IAST: Ardhanārīśvara) is a composite androgynous form of the Hindu deities Shiva and Parvati (also known as Shakti). The deity is depicted as half male and half female, split down the middle. Typically, the right half is the male Shiva, adorned with his attributes, and the left half is the female Parvati, characterized by her features. Ardhanarishvara represents the synthesis of masculine and feminine energies, illustrating how Shiva and Shakti are inseparable aspects of the divine. The icon signifies the unity of opposites, the interdependence of Purusha (the male principle) and Prakriti (the female principle), and the essential harmony required for creation and sustenance of the universe.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
