Often depicted as a consort of Brahma, the creator god, she represents the embodiment of knowledge, purity, and the power of sound. As a vital aspect of Hindu spiritual practice, particularly for Brahmins, Gayatri is considered the mother of the Vedas and a source of divine energy and enlightenment. She is invoked for wisdom, prosperity, and spiritual growth. Her significance lies in her association with the most revered mantra in Hinduism, making her central to daily prayers, initiations, and various religious rituals.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
