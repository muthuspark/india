      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;aravan-a-comprehensive-overview&#34;&gt;Aravan: A Comprehensive Overview&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;h3 id=&#34;introduction&#34;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Aravan, also known as Iravat, is a complex and intriguing minor character derived from the epic Mahabharata. He is predominantly revered as a significant deity in the cult of Kuttantavar, particularly in Tamil Nadu, India. Though not a mainstream figure in pan-Indian Hindu traditions, Aravan’s significance lies in his unique sacrifice and association with transgender communities. His worship embodies themes of devotion, selflessness, and a complex understanding of dharma. While not typically depicted in traditional iconography outside of his cult following, representations often portray him with a severed head, symbolizing his ultimate sacrifice. In Hinduism, he represents a poignant reminder of the sacrifices made in the pursuit of victory and the nuances of duty.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

He is celebrated for his unwavering commitment to dharma (righteousness), his formidable martial prowess, and, most significantly, his solemn vow of celibacy, which ultimately shaped the course of the epic. Though not typically considered a deity in the same vein as Vishnu or Shiva, Bhishma is often regarded as a divine figure owing to his extraordinary virtues and the circumstances of his birth. His key attributes are his wisdom, strength, self-sacrifice, and devotion to the Kuru dynasty. Iconographically, he is often depicted as a wise, elderly warrior, clad in armor and lying on a bed of arrows. Bhishma’s significance in Hinduism lies in his embodiment of duty, honor, and the consequences of one&amp;rsquo;s choices, serving as a moral compass throughout the epic.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
