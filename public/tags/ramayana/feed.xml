&lt;h3 id="introduction"&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hanuman, also known as Anjaneya, is one of the most beloved and revered deities in Hinduism. He is celebrated for his unparalleled devotion to Lord Rama, his extraordinary strength, unwavering courage, and selfless service. Often depicted as a monkey-faced humanoid, Hanuman embodies the ideals of &lt;em&gt;bhakti&lt;/em&gt; (devotion), &lt;em&gt;shakti&lt;/em&gt; (power), and &lt;em&gt;buddhi&lt;/em&gt; (wisdom). His iconography typically portrays him as a muscular figure, often carrying the &lt;em&gt;gada&lt;/em&gt; (mace), a symbol of his might. Hanuman holds a prominent position in the Hindu pantheon, particularly within the Vaishnava tradition, and is venerated as a protector, a source of strength, and a symbol of unwavering faith.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Jatayu</title><link>https://india.muthu.co/posts/gods/jatayu/</link><pubDate>Sun, 01 Dec 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://india.muthu.co/posts/gods/jatayu/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="jatayu-the-noble-eagle-of-the-ramayana"&gt;Jatayu: The Noble Eagle of the Ramayana&lt;/h2&gt;

He is often depicted as a large, majestic eagle with human-like intelligence and compassion. His significance lies in his demonstration of dharma and his ultimate sacrifice.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Rama</title><link>https://india.muthu.co/posts/gods/rama/</link><pubDate>Sun, 01 Dec 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://india.muthu.co/posts/gods/rama/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="rama-embodiment-of-dharma-and-ideal-king"&gt;Rama: Embodiment of Dharma and Ideal King&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rama, also known as Ramachandra, is a major deity in Hinduism, revered as the seventh avatar of Vishnu. He is the central figure of the &lt;em&gt;Ramayana&lt;/em&gt;, one of the two great Indian epics. Rama is widely considered the embodiment of &lt;em&gt;dharma&lt;/em&gt; (righteousness, duty), ideal manhood, perfect fatherhood, and exemplary kingship. His consort, Sita, is revered as an embodiment of ideal womanhood and conjugal devotion. His significance in Hinduism is profound, influencing religious practices, art, literature, and societal values for millennia.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Essential Guide to Visiting Rameshwaram</title><link>https://india.muthu.co/posts/places/rameshwaram/</link><pubDate>Sat, 12 Aug 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://india.muthu.co/posts/places/rameshwaram/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Rameshvaram is a sacred island located off the southeastern coast of Tamil Nadu, India. Its name literally means &amp;ldquo;Rama the god,&amp;rdquo; reflecting its profound religious significance in Hindu tradition. This island is considered one of the holiest pilgrimage destinations in India, holding immense spiritual importance for devotees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="mythological-significance"&gt;Mythological Significance&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the epic Ramayana, Lord Rama stopped at Rameshvaram to purify himself after defeating and killing the demon king Ravana. This act of purification was essential for Rama, as killing Ravana (who was a Brahmin by birth) required ritual cleansing.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
