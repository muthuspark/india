      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;pushan-the-guardian-of-roads-and-livestock&#34;&gt;Pushan: The Guardian of Roads and Livestock&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;h3 id=&#34;introduction&#34;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Pushan, also spelled Pusan, is a prominent solar deity in the Hindu pantheon, primarily associated with journeys, roads, livestock, and general prosperity. He is often invoked for safe travel, finding lost objects, and ensuring the well-being of cattle, which were vital to the ancient Vedic economy and lifestyle. Pushan represents a benevolent and nurturing aspect of the Sun, guiding and protecting those who rely on his grace. He is a significant, albeit less frequently worshipped today, figure whose role highlights the importance of safe passage, prosperity, and the connection to the land in Vedic and early Hindu thought.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
