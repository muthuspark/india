&lt;h3 id="introduction"&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Danu is a significant, albeit often overlooked, goddess in Hindu mythology. Primarily known as the mother of the Danavas, a powerful race of demons who frequently clashed with the Devas (gods), Danu embodies the primordial waters and is associated with fertility, abundance, and the undercurrents of creation. While not as widely worshipped as other prominent Hindu goddesses like Lakshmi or Durga, her role in the cosmology of conflict and the origins of powerful beings grants her an important place within the Hindu pantheon. She represents the creative force that, when uncontrolled, can manifest as chaos and opposition.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Varuna</title><link>https://india.muthu.co/posts/gods/varuna/</link><pubDate>Sun, 01 Dec 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://india.muthu.co/posts/gods/varuna/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="varuna-god-of-the-cosmic-waters-and-divine-law"&gt;Varuna: God of the Cosmic Waters and Divine Law&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="introduction"&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Varuna is a prominent Hindu deity initially revered as a sovereign of cosmic order, law, and justice, and later primarily associated with the waters, oceans, rivers, and aquatic creatures. He holds a significant position within the Hindu pantheon, particularly in the early Vedic period, where he is considered one of the most important Adityas, a group of solar deities. Varuna embodies both the creative and regulatory aspects of the cosmos, enforcing moral and ritual order while overseeing the vastness of the oceans and waterways. His iconography often depicts him as a regal figure, seated on a Makara (a mythical aquatic creature) or a throne, symbolizing his dominion over the watery realms. While his prominence waned in later Hindu traditions, Varuna remains a crucial figure in understanding the evolution of Hindu cosmology and ethics.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
