      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;dharma-shasta-an-encyclopedic-overview&#34;&gt;Dharma Shasta: An Encyclopedic Overview&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;h3 id=&#34;introduction&#34;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Dharma Shasta, also known as Ayyappan or Manikandan, is a popular deity primarily worshipped in South India, particularly in Kerala and Tamil Nadu. He is revered as the embodiment of dharma (righteousness) and is often depicted as a celibate yogi, a warrior, or a divine child. Dharma Shasta is unique in Hinduism due to his origin â€“ he is believed to be the son of Shiva and Mohini, the female avatar of Vishnu. His worship is characterized by intricate pilgrimages, strict vows, and the chanting of devotional hymns. Understanding Dharma Shasta offers valuable insights into the syncretic nature of Hindu belief and the importance of dharma in spiritual pursuits.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
