He is considered the creator of forms, the builder of the universe, and the maker of divine instruments and weapons. Tvashtri is associated with skill, ingenuity, and the creative power that shapes and sustains the cosmos. While not as widely worshipped as some other deities, Tvashtri’s role as the celestial artisan is essential to the Hindu cosmological framework. He is often depicted as a skilled artisan with tools, a measuring rod, or a chalice, symbolizing his craftsmanship and creative abilities. His significance lies in representing the inherent creative force in the universe and the transformative power of skilled artistry.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
