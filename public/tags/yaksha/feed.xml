He holds the esteemed position of being the lord of the Yakshas, a class of semi-divine beings associated with wealth, prosperity, and natural treasures. As such, Yaksheshvara is often depicted as the divine treasurer and guardian of wealth, revered for his role in bestowing abundance upon his devotees. His iconography typically portrays him as a stout figure adorned with jewels, symbolizing his dominion over riches. Yaksheshvara’s significance lies in his representation of material well-being and his association with ethical acquisition and distribution of wealth within the framework of Hindu dharma.
