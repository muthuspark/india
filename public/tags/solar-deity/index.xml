      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;bhaga-god-of-fortune-marriage-and-prosperity-in-hinduism&#34;&gt;Bhaga: God of Fortune, Marriage, and Prosperity in Hinduism&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;h3 id=&#34;introduction&#34;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Bhaga is a significant, albeit often less prominent, member of the Adityas, the solar deities in Hinduism. He embodies fortune, wealth, marriage, and overall prosperity. As a celestial being, Bhaga is invoked for blessings related to material well-being, harmonious relationships, and success in various endeavors. While not as widely worshipped as some of his Aditya brethren like Surya or Vishnu (as Vamana), Bhaga holds a distinct place in the Hindu pantheon, particularly in Vedic literature and domestic rituals. His iconography is not standardized across all traditions, but he is generally depicted as a benevolent deity adorned with symbols of abundance and auspiciousness. His significance lies in representing the tangible benefits and joys of a righteous life lived in accordance with dharma.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
