&lt;h3 id="introduction"&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hrishikesh, derived from the Sanskrit language, is a prominent name and epithet of the Hindu god Vishnu, revered as the preserver and sustainer of the universe within the Hindu Trimurti (Trinity). The name translates to &amp;ldquo;Lord of the Senses,&amp;rdquo; indicating mastery over the senses and a deep connection to inner peace and control. Hrishikesh is not typically depicted with unique iconography separate from Vishnu&amp;rsquo;s general representations; he is usually portrayed with the standard attributes of Vishnu, such as the conch (Shankha), discus (Chakra), lotus (Padma), and mace (Gada). He holds significant importance in Hinduism, particularly within Vaishnavism, as a representation of the divine power capable of guiding individuals towards liberation (moksha) through sensory control and devotion.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
