&lt;h3 id="introduction"&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bhutamata, a prominent yet often subtly invoked deity in Hinduism, is revered as the primordial Mother of all beings and the elements that constitute the universe. Her name, literally meaning &amp;ldquo;Mother of the Bhutas (elements/beings),&amp;rdquo; encapsulates her role as the source and sustainer of creation. While not always featured as a distinct deity in iconography or separate temple complexes, the concept of Bhutamata is deeply interwoven with the broader understanding of the Divine Feminine, particularly in Shaktism, and her presence is felt in the veneration of various Goddesses. She embodies the fundamental creative power and nurturing force that brings forth and maintains existence. Her significance lies in recognizing the interconnectedness of all life and the elemental forces that shape the cosmos.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
