      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;aruna-the-dawns-charioteer-in-hindu-cosmology&#34;&gt;Aruna: The Dawn&amp;rsquo;s Charioteer in Hindu Cosmology&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;h3 id=&#34;introduction&#34;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Aruna, in Hinduism, is the personification of the reddish glow of the rising sun, specifically associated with the dawn. He is more than just a representation of this celestial phenomenon; he is a significant deity in his own right, believed to possess spiritual powers and play a crucial role in guiding the sun god, Surya, across the sky. Typically depicted as a charioteer, Aruna’s most prominent attribute is his limblessness or diminished physical form. His iconography consistently portrays him driving Surya’s chariot, an image central to his significance in Hindu mythology. Aruna represents the transition from darkness to light, embodying hope, anticipation, and the promise of a new day.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
