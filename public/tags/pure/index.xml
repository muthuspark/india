      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;gangotri-the-divine-source-of-the-ganges-river&#34;&gt;Gangotri: The Divine Source of the Ganges River&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;h3 id=&#34;introduction&#34;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Gangotri, revered in Hinduism as a goddess and the personification of the sacred Ganges River, holds immense religious significance. She is considered the source point of the Ganges, one of India&amp;rsquo;s most holy rivers, and her presence embodies purity, liberation, and the cleansing of sins. Gangotri is not considered a major deity within the Hindu pantheon in the same way as goddesses like Durga or Lakshmi. However, her association with the Ganges elevates her status, making her central to pilgrimage, ritual bathing, and the pursuit of spiritual enlightenment. Key attributes include her association with purity, fertility, and the flow of life. Her iconography typically depicts her as a beautiful, serene woman, often holding a water pot (kamandalu) and sometimes seated on a crocodile, her &lt;em&gt;vahana&lt;/em&gt; (vehicle). Her significance lies in her ability to purify and liberate devotees from the cycle of rebirth (moksha).&lt;/p&gt;</description>
