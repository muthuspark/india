      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;vishnu-the-preserver-god-in-hinduism&#34;&gt;Vishnu: The Preserver God in Hinduism&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;h3 id=&#34;introduction&#34;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Vishnu, a central deity in Hinduism, is revered as the preserver and protector of the universe. He is one of the Trimurti, the Hindu trinity, alongside Brahma (the creator) and Shiva (the destroyer). Vishnu embodies the principles of dharma, karma, and moksha, playing a crucial role in maintaining cosmic order and ensuring the continuation of life. Often depicted with a serene countenance, adorned with royal garments, and carrying significant symbols, Vishnu is worshipped by millions of Hindus worldwide. His significance extends beyond simple preservation; he is also seen as the embodiment of divine love and compassion, intervening in the world through his avatars to restore balance when it is threatened by evil.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
