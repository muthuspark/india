      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;diti-mother-of-the-daityas-in-hindu-mythology&#34;&gt;Diti: Mother of the Daityas in Hindu Mythology&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;h3 id=&#34;introduction&#34;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Diti (दिति) is a significant figure in Hindu mythology, primarily known as the mother of the Daityas, a powerful race of demons who often oppose the Devas (gods). Sister to Aditi, the mother of the Adityas (gods), Diti&amp;rsquo;s narrative explores themes of ambition, rivalry, and the constant conflict between good and evil. While not typically worshipped in temples, her story is integral to understanding the cosmic balance within Hindu cosmology and the origins of the recurring battles between deities and demons. She is an important figure in understanding the dynamics of the divine and the demonic within Hindu narratives.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
