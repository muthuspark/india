      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;hari-a-comprehensive-overview-of-the-remover-of-sins-in-hinduism&#34;&gt;Hari: A Comprehensive Overview of the Remover of Sins in Hinduism&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;h3 id=&#34;introduction&#34;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Hari, a significant name in Hinduism, is primarily used as a designation for Vishnu and his avatar Krishna. The term signifies &amp;ldquo;the remover of sins,&amp;rdquo; highlighting one of the core aspects of the deity&amp;rsquo;s role: to liberate devotees from the cycle of karma and guide them towards liberation (moksha). Hari is revered as the preserver of the universe and a protector of dharma (righteousness). Iconographically, Hari often appears in human form, adorned with royal garments, holding symbols of power and auspiciousness, and sometimes depicted with a blue complexion, reflecting his cosmic nature. His significance in Hinduism stems from his association with maintaining cosmic order, granting grace to his devotees, and embodying the divine qualities of love, compassion, and justice.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
