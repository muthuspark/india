&lt;h3 id="introduction"&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ganga, revered as a goddess in Hinduism, is the personification of the Ganges River, the most sacred river in India. She is a prominent deity, deeply embedded in the religious, cultural, and spiritual fabric of the Indian subcontinent. Ganga is venerated for her purifying powers, her ability to wash away sins, and her association with liberation (moksha).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Attributes and Iconography:&lt;/strong&gt; Ganga is typically depicted as a beautiful woman, often fair-skinned, adorned with rich jewelry and garments. She is commonly shown riding her mount, the Makara (a mythical creature that is part crocodile, part dolphin), and holding a water pot (kamandalu) and a lotus flower. Sometimes, she is depicted with four arms, symbolizing her multifaceted nature.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Yamuna</title><link>https://india.muthu.co/posts/gods/yamuna/</link><pubDate>Sun, 01 Dec 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://india.muthu.co/posts/gods/yamuna/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="yamuna-the-sacred-river-goddess-of-hinduism"&gt;Yamuna: The Sacred River Goddess of Hinduism&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="introduction"&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yamuna, also known as Jamuna, is a prominent goddess in Hinduism, revered as the personification of the Yamuna River, one of India&amp;rsquo;s most sacred waterways. As the daughter of the sun god Surya and twin sister of Yama, the god of death, Yamuna holds a significant position within the Hindu pantheon. She is venerated not just as a river, but as a divine being capable of bestowing blessings, purification, and ultimately, liberation. Yamuna is often depicted as a beautiful woman, usually dark complexioned, riding her mount, the tortoise, and holding a pot of water, symbolizing abundance and fertility. Her significance stems from her association with purity, immortality, and the holy city of Vrindavan, where Lord Krishna spent his childhood.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
