      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;anumati-lunar-goddess-of-wealth-intellect-and-prosperity&#34;&gt;Anumati: Lunar Goddess of Wealth, Intellect, and Prosperity&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;h3 id=&#34;introduction&#34;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Anumati is a Hindu goddess associated with the lunar cycle, wealth, intellect, progeny, spirituality, and overall prosperity. Often depicted with the blackbuck as her vahana (vehicle), Anumati represents permission, approval, and auspicious beginnings. While not as widely recognized as some of the more prominent Hindu deities, Anumati holds significant importance in specific traditions and contexts, particularly those emphasizing the connection between lunar phases and auspiciousness. Her iconography often features symbols associated with both the moon and prosperity, reflecting her multifaceted nature. Her significance lies in her role as a facilitator of positive outcomes and the embodiment of divine grace that bestows blessings upon devotees.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
