      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;pashupati-lord-of-beasts-and-souls&#34;&gt;Pashupati: Lord of Beasts and Souls&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;h3 id=&#34;introduction&#34;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Pashupati is a prominent form of the Hindu god Shiva, representing him as the &amp;ldquo;Lord of Animals&amp;rdquo; (pashu meaning &amp;ldquo;beast&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;soul,&amp;rdquo; and pati meaning &amp;ldquo;lord&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;master&amp;rdquo;). This aspect of Shiva embodies his dominion over the animal kingdom, both literal and metaphorical, encompassing not only beasts of the forest but also the primal instincts and desires within human beings. Pashupati&amp;rsquo;s iconography typically depicts Shiva in a yogic posture, often surrounded by animals, emphasizing his role as a protector and guide of all living beings, particularly those considered untamed or instinctual. His significance in Hinduism lies in his representation of the control and transcendence over the lower nature, leading devotees towards spiritual liberation (moksha). Pashupati embodies the divine shepherd guiding his flock (the souls) towards enlightenment.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
