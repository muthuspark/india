&lt;h3 id="introduction"&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dhatri, a significant yet often understated deity in Hinduism, represents the sustaining aspect of the divine principle, Brahman. Commonly associated with Brahma, the creator, Dhatri embodies the maintenance and upholding of the cosmic order after creation. He is the vital force that ensures the continuation of life, prosperity, and the natural laws that govern the universe. Although not always the central focus of worship, Dhatri&amp;rsquo;s role as the sustainer makes him integral to the cyclical process of creation, preservation, and dissolution that defines the Hindu cosmological framework.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
