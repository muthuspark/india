&lt;h3 id="introduction"&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aryaman is an early Vedic deity in Hinduism, often described as a solar Aditya and one of the sons of the goddess Aditi. His name signifies &amp;ldquo;bosom friend,&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;companion,&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;partner,&amp;rdquo; reflecting his role as a guardian of friendship, contracts, and societal obligations. While not as prominently featured as deities like Indra or Agni in later Hindu traditions, Aryaman holds a significant place in the Vedic pantheon, particularly as a symbol of righteous conduct and the continuity of lineage. The Milky Way is sometimes considered his path or territory.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
