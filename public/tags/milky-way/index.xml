      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;aryaman-the-vedic-god-of-friendship-obligations-and-lineage&#34;&gt;Aryaman: The Vedic God of Friendship, Obligations, and Lineage&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;h3 id=&#34;introduction&#34;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Aryaman is an early Vedic deity in Hinduism, often described as a solar Aditya and one of the sons of the goddess Aditi. His name signifies &amp;ldquo;bosom friend,&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;companion,&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;partner,&amp;rdquo; reflecting his role as a guardian of friendship, contracts, and societal obligations. While not as prominently featured as deities like Indra or Agni in later Hindu traditions, Aryaman holds a significant place in the Vedic pantheon, particularly as a symbol of righteous conduct and the continuity of lineage. The Milky Way is sometimes considered his path or territory.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
