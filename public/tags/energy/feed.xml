&lt;h3 id="introduction"&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shakti, often translated as “power” or “energy,” represents the primordial cosmic energy and the dynamic force that underlies the universe in Hinduism. She is the divine feminine creative power and is considered the active principle of all existence. While Brahman is often viewed as the static, unchanging, and unmanifested reality, Shakti is the dynamic, evolving, and manifested aspect of Brahman, bringing the universe into being. She is not simply a goddess but the very essence of divinity that empowers the male deities.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Surya</title><link>https://india.muthu.co/posts/gods/surya/</link><pubDate>Sun, 01 Dec 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://india.muthu.co/posts/gods/surya/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="surya-the-radiant-sun-god-in-hinduism"&gt;Surya: The Radiant Sun God in Hinduism&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="introduction"&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Surya, the Sun god, is a major deity in Hinduism, revered as the source of light, warmth, and life on Earth. Often depicted riding a golden chariot pulled by seven horses, Surya embodies energy, illumination, and vitality. He is a vital force in the cosmos, responsible for the cycle of day and night, seasons, and the overall well-being of the world. Surya&amp;rsquo;s influence extends beyond the physical realm, encompassing spiritual enlightenment and dispelling ignorance.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
