      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;shakti-the-divine-feminine-creative-power-in-hinduism&#34;&gt;Shakti: The Divine Feminine Creative Power in Hinduism&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;h3 id=&#34;introduction&#34;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Shakti, often translated as “power” or “energy,” represents the primordial cosmic energy and the dynamic force that underlies the universe in Hinduism. She is the divine feminine creative power and is considered the active principle of all existence. While Brahman is often viewed as the static, unchanging, and unmanifested reality, Shakti is the dynamic, evolving, and manifested aspect of Brahman, bringing the universe into being. She is not simply a goddess but the very essence of divinity that empowers the male deities.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
