He is considered one of the Saptarishis (the seven great sages) and a significant figure in Hindu mythology, literature, and spirituality. Agastya&amp;rsquo;s influence extends beyond religious spheres, impacting fields such as medicine, grammar, and astrology. His iconography typically depicts him as an elderly ascetic with a long beard, often holding a kamandala (water pot) and a rosary. He embodies wisdom, austerity, and the power of knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
