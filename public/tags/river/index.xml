Yamuna is often depicted as a beautiful woman, usually dark complexioned, riding her mount, the tortoise, and holding a pot of water, symbolizing abundance and fertility. Her significance stems from her association with purity, immortality, and the holy city of Vrindavan, where Lord Krishna spent his childhood.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
