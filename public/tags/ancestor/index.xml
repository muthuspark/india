      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;daksha-progenitor-sacrificer-and-figure-of-conflict&#34;&gt;Daksha: Progenitor, Sacrificer, and Figure of Conflict&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;h3 id=&#34;introduction&#34;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Daksha, one of the prominent Prajapatis (progenitors of mankind) in Hindu mythology, is a complex and significant figure. He is primarily known as the father of Sati, the first consort of Lord Shiva, and for his infamous &lt;em&gt;yajna&lt;/em&gt; (sacrifice) that led to Sati&amp;rsquo;s self-immolation. He embodies both creative power and potential conflict with divine forces, making him a recurring figure in Hindu narratives. While not directly worshipped in a dedicated manner like some other deities, his role within the Shiva-Sati cycle and as a Prajapati solidifies his enduring significance in Hinduism.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
