&lt;h3 id="introduction"&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Daksha, one of the prominent Prajapatis (progenitors of mankind) in Hindu mythology, is a complex and significant figure. He is primarily known as the father of Sati, the first consort of Lord Shiva, and for his infamous &lt;em&gt;yajna&lt;/em&gt; (sacrifice) that led to Sati&amp;rsquo;s self-immolation. He embodies both creative power and potential conflict with divine forces, making him a recurring figure in Hindu narratives. While not directly worshipped in a dedicated manner like some other deities, his role within the Shiva-Sati cycle and as a Prajapati solidifies his enduring significance in Hinduism.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
