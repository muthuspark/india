      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;brahman-the-ultimate-reality-in-hinduism&#34;&gt;Brahman: The Ultimate Reality in Hinduism&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;h3 id=&#34;introduction&#34;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In Hinduism, Brahman (ब्रह्मन्) represents the ultimate reality, the infinite, unchanging, eternal, and absolute principle underlying all existence. It is the supreme cosmic power and the source of everything that is, was, and ever will be. Brahman is not a deity in the traditional sense with a specific form or personality, but rather the unmanifested ground of being from which all gods and goddesses, the universe, and all beings emanate. Understanding Brahman is central to achieving &lt;em&gt;moksha&lt;/em&gt; (liberation) in many Hindu traditions. While not typically depicted with iconography like other deities, the symbol &amp;ldquo;Om&amp;rdquo; (ॐ) is often used to represent its essence. The significance of Brahman lies in its role as the foundation of reality and the goal of spiritual realization.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
