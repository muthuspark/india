&lt;h3 id="introduction"&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vishvarupa (Sanskrit: विश्वरूप, Viśvarūpa, meaning &amp;ldquo;Universal Form&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;All-Form&amp;rdquo;) is a theophany representing the cosmic form of Vishnu or, in some contexts, Krishna. This manifestation reveals the totality of existence, encompassing all beings, objects, and phenomena within a single, awe-inspiring form. The Vishvarupa is not a specific deity in itself, but rather a powerful and transient revelation of the divine essence, demonstrating the all-pervading nature of Vishnu/Krishna. It is a profound concept in Hindu theology that emphasizes the immanence and transcendence of the divine. Key attributes associated with Vishvarupa include boundless scale, infinite forms, and the simultaneous presence of creation, preservation, and destruction. Iconographically, it is represented as a form that contains within it the entire universe, often depicted with countless faces, eyes, arms, and legs. The significance of Vishvarupa lies in its ability to convey the ultimate reality of Brahman, the Supreme Reality, and its manifestation in the manifested world.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
