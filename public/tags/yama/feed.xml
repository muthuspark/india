&lt;h3 id="introduction"&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bharani, derived from the Sanskrit word meaning &amp;ldquo;bearing&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;carrying,&amp;rdquo; is the second Nakshatra, or lunar mansion, in Hindu astrology. This Nakshatra, spanning 13°20&amp;rsquo; to 26°40&amp;rsquo; Aries, is associated with themes of transformation, endurance, and the cycles of life and death. While Bharani isn&amp;rsquo;t typically personified as a deity in the same way as gods like Vishnu or Shiva, it is ruled by Yama, the god of death and dharma, and connected to the concept of Apabharani, representing the power to cleanse and purify. Its primary attribute revolves around the energy of beginnings and endings, often requiring individuals to face challenges with resilience and determination. Its significance lies in understanding the karmic burdens we carry and the transformative power that comes from confronting and overcoming them.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
