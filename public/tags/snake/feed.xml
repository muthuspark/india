      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;tejaji-the-snake-protecting-folk-deity-of-rajasthan&#34;&gt;Tejaji: The Snake-Protecting Folk Deity of Rajasthan&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;h3 id=&#34;introduction&#34;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Tejaji, also known as Veer Tejaji, is a revered folk deity primarily worshipped in Rajasthan, India. He is widely recognized as a protector of cows, a defender of the oppressed, and a figure associated with snakes and their venom. Tejaji&amp;rsquo;s iconography typically depicts him as a courageous warrior, often shown riding a mare and being bitten by a serpent on his tongue. His widespread popularity stems from his perceived ability to cure snake bites and provide protection from various ailments. While not directly derived from classical Hindu scriptures, Tejaji represents a vibrant example of local traditions and syncretism within the broader Hindu religious landscape.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
