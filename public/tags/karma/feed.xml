&lt;h3 id="introduction"&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shani, also known as Śanaiścara, is a prominent Hindu deity associated with the planet Saturn (Śani). Revered as the dispenser of justice and the lord of karma, Shani&amp;rsquo;s influence on an individual&amp;rsquo;s life is considered profound. He is neither inherently benevolent nor malevolent, but rather a force of cosmic balance, rewarding righteous actions and punishing wrongdoing. His key attributes include a slow pace (Śanaiścara literally means &amp;ldquo;slow-moving&amp;rdquo;), discipline, austerity, and profound wisdom born of experience. Iconographically, Shani is often depicted as dark in complexion, adorned with black clothing, and riding a crow or buffalo. In Hinduism, Shani holds significant importance as a judge of moral behavior and a facilitator of spiritual growth through karmic retribution.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
