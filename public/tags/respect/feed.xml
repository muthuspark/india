In India, a growing movement is embracing &amp;ldquo;Parents&amp;rsquo; Worship Day&amp;rdquo; on February 14th, not as a replacement for romantic love, but as a powerful complement – a dedicated day to honor the unwavering love, sacrifice, and guidance that our parents provide.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Teacher's Day</title><link>https://india.muthu.co/posts/festivals/teachers-day/</link><pubDate>Sun, 01 Dec 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://india.muthu.co/posts/festivals/teachers-day/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="more-than-just-apples-celebrating-teachers-day-in-india"&gt;More Than Just Apples: Celebrating Teacher&amp;rsquo;s Day in India&lt;/h2&gt;
