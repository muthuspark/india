      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;beyond-roses-celebrating-the-unconditional-love-of-parents-worship-day&#34;&gt;Beyond Roses: Celebrating the Unconditional Love of Parents&amp;rsquo; Worship Day&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Valentine&amp;rsquo;s Day. The very words conjure images of red roses, heart-shaped chocolates, and candlelit dinners. But what if I told you there was an alternative, a day equally devoted to love, but one that celebrates the very foundation of our being: our parents? In India, a growing movement is embracing &amp;ldquo;Parents&amp;rsquo; Worship Day&amp;rdquo; on February 14th, not as a replacement for romantic love, but as a powerful complement – a dedicated day to honor the unwavering love, sacrifice, and guidance that our parents provide.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
