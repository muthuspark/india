&lt;h3 id="introduction"&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Purusha, a Sanskrit word meaning &amp;ldquo;man,&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;self,&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;consciousness,&amp;rdquo; occupies a central position in Hindu cosmology and philosophy. He is conceived as the primordial cosmic being, the source and essence of the universe. The iconic image associated with Purusha is his sacrifice, which is described in ancient Vedic texts as the act that initiated creation and gave rise to all aspects of existence, including the social order, the natural world, and the deities themselves. While not directly worshipped in the same manner as deities like Vishnu or Shiva, Purusha&amp;rsquo;s concept remains fundamentally important as a framework for understanding the nature of reality and the interconnectedness of all things within Hinduism.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
