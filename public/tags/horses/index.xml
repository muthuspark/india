      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;aswini-divine-physicians-and-the-first-nakshatra&#34;&gt;Aswini: Divine Physicians and the First Nakshatra&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;h3 id=&#34;introduction&#34;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The Ashvins (also spelled Aswins), also known as the Ashwini Kumaras, are twin Hindu deities revered as divine physicians and healers. They are associated with health, rejuvenation, and dawn, often depicted as handsome youths riding golden chariots. Their association with the first nakshatra (lunar mansion) in Hindu astrology, Ashwini, which corresponds to the head of Aries, underscores their connection to new beginnings and auspiciousness. The Ashvins are prominent figures in Vedic literature and continue to be venerated, albeit to a lesser extent than more prominent deities like Vishnu or Shiva.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
