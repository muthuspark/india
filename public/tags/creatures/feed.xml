      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;prajapati-lord-of-creation-in-hinduism&#34;&gt;Prajapati: Lord of Creation in Hinduism&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;h3 id=&#34;introduction&#34;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Prajapati, a prominent deity in Hinduism, is often referred to as the &amp;ldquo;Lord of Creatures&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;Lord of Progeny.&amp;rdquo; He embodies the generative power of the cosmos and is closely associated with the act of creation itself. While sometimes identified with Brahma, the creator god in the Hindu Trimurti, Prajapati often represents a more primordial or abstract principle of creation. He is a complex and multifaceted figure, whose understanding varies across different Hindu texts and traditions. His significance lies in his role as the progenitor of life and the overseer of dharma. He is often depicted as an elderly sage, symbolizing wisdom and experience.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
