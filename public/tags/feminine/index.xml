      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;vinayaki-the-elephant-headed-goddess-of-wisdom-and-prosperity&#34;&gt;Vinayaki: The Elephant-Headed Goddess of Wisdom and Prosperity&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;h3 id=&#34;introduction&#34;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Vinayaki, also known by several other names, is a Hindu goddess characterized by her elephant head. She is considered the female counterpart of Ganesha, the popular elephant-headed god of wisdom, prosperity, and the remover of obstacles. Though less widely known than her male counterpart, Vinayaki is revered as a powerful deity embodying similar attributes and powers. She is often depicted with an elephantine face, a feminine body, and multiple arms, each holding symbolic objects. The presence of Vinayaki highlights the feminine principle (Shakti) within the Hindu pantheon and the androgynous nature of the divine.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
