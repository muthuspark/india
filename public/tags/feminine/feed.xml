&lt;h3 id="introduction"&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vinayaki, also known by several other names, is a Hindu goddess characterized by her elephant head. She is considered the female counterpart of Ganesha, the popular elephant-headed god of wisdom, prosperity, and the remover of obstacles. Though less widely known than her male counterpart, Vinayaki is revered as a powerful deity embodying similar attributes and powers. She is often depicted with an elephantine face, a feminine body, and multiple arms, each holding symbolic objects. The presence of Vinayaki highlights the feminine principle (Shakti) within the Hindu pantheon and the androgynous nature of the divine.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
