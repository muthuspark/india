      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;sita-embodiment-of-virtue-and-feminine-ideal-in-hindu-tradition&#34;&gt;Sita: Embodiment of Virtue and Feminine Ideal in Hindu Tradition&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;h3 id=&#34;introduction&#34;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Sita, also known as Janaki, is a central figure in Hinduism, revered as the consort of Lord Rama and an embodiment of wifely devotion, feminine virtue, and strength in adversity. She is a primary deity in the Vaishnava tradition, embodying Lakshmi, the goddess of prosperity and auspiciousness. Sita&amp;rsquo;s life, as narrated primarily in the epic Ramayana, serves as a potent symbol of purity, self-sacrifice, and unwavering commitment to dharma. Her iconography usually depicts her as a beautiful and graceful woman, often adorned with traditional Indian attire, standing alongside Rama or in a gesture of offering. Sita&amp;rsquo;s significance lies not only in her divine status but also in the profound ethical and spiritual lessons she imparts through her story.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
