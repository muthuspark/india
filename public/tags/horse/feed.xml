&lt;h3 id="introduction"&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Revanta is a relatively lesser-known, yet significant, solar deity in the Hindu pantheon. He is primarily recognized as the son of Surya, the Sun God, and his consort Saranyu. Revanta is regarded as the patron deity of the &lt;em&gt;Adityas&lt;/em&gt;, a class of solar deities, and is particularly associated with hunting, horsemanship, and protection from dangers in the wilderness. His iconography typically depicts him as a princely figure mounted on a horse, equipped with hunting implements. Although not as widely worshipped as other major deities, Revanta holds a crucial place in understanding the multifaceted nature of solar worship and the connection between divine power and earthly pursuits in Hinduism. He is often invoked for protection, courage, and success in adventurous endeavors.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
