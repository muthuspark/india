&lt;h3 id="introduction"&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lakshmi is one of the principal goddesses in Hinduism, revered as the deity of wealth, fortune, prosperity (both material and spiritual), beauty, and fertility. She is considered the consort of Vishnu, one of the Trimurti (the Hindu trinity), and plays a significant role in both mythology and daily worship. As the embodiment of auspiciousness and abundance, Lakshmi is essential to Hindu concepts of well-being and prosperity.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
