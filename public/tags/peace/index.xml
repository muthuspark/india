      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;buddha-as-an-avatar-of-vishnu-in-hinduism-an-encyclopedic-overview&#34;&gt;Buddha as an Avatar of Vishnu in Hinduism: An Encyclopedic Overview&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;h3 id=&#34;introduction&#34;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In certain traditions of Hinduism, particularly Vaishnavism, Buddha is considered an avatar (incarnation) of the Hindu god Vishnu, one of the principal deities of the Hindu trinity (Trimurti). While the historical figure Siddhartha Gautama, the founder of Buddhism, is central to Buddhist philosophy and practice, the Hindu understanding views Buddha as a strategic avatar of Vishnu sent to Earth for specific purposes. Key attributes associated with Buddha as an avatar of Vishnu include compassion, wisdom, and a focus on ethical conduct. His iconography in Hindu contexts is often a recognizable depiction of the meditating Buddha figure. The significance of Buddha as an avatar lies in his role within the cyclical narratives of Hindu cosmology and his perceived impact on societal and religious developments.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
