&lt;h3 id="introduction"&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vasuki, a prominent figure in Hindu mythology, is revered as the King of the Serpents (Nagas). He is most famously known for his role in the Samudra Manthan, the churning of the cosmic ocean, and for adorning Lord Shiva&amp;rsquo;s neck as a necklace, symbolizing Shiva&amp;rsquo;s mastery over fear and death. Vasuki is generally depicted as a colossal serpent, embodying immense power and cosmic significance. His presence is often invoked for protection, wisdom, and the attainment of spiritual liberation.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
