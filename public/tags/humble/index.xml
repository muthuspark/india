      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;vamana-the-dwarf-avatar-of-vishnu&#34;&gt;Vamana: The Dwarf Avatar of Vishnu&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;h3 id=&#34;introduction&#34;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Vamana, the dwarf avatar of Vishnu, is a significant deity in Hinduism, revered for his role in restoring cosmic balance and upholding dharma. As the fifth avatar in the Dashavatara (ten principal avatars of Vishnu), Vamana is celebrated for his wisdom, humility, and unwavering commitment to justice. He is primarily known for humbling King Bali, a powerful Asura king who, despite his virtuous rule, threatened the sovereignty of the gods. Vamana&amp;rsquo;s key attributes include his diminutive stature, his ascetic appearance, and his extraordinary intellect. Iconographically, he is depicted as a dwarf brahmin holding a wooden umbrella (chattra), a water pot (kamandalu), and sometimes a rosary (akshamala). His significance lies in showcasing Vishnu&amp;rsquo;s power to overcome even the mightiest adversaries through intelligence and adherence to dharma, emphasizing the importance of humility and righteous conduct.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
