He is traditionally recognized as the commander-in-chief (Senapati) of the armies of Lord Vishnu, the preserver deity in the Hindu trinity (Trimurti). Vishvaksena is considered an important figure in the Sri Vaishnava tradition, where he holds a position of great reverence and is often worshipped as an important intermediary between devotees and Vishnu. He is considered to be an aspect of Vishnu himself and represents righteousness and the upholding of cosmic order. His significance stems from his role as the protector of Vishnu&amp;rsquo;s devotees and the eliminator of obstacles in their spiritual path. He is often depicted with multiple arms holding various weapons and emblems symbolizing his power and duty.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
