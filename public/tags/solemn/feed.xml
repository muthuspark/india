&lt;p&gt;Have you ever felt the weight of silence, a palpable stillness that speaks volumes? That’s the atmosphere that often envelops India on Good Friday, a day observed by Christians worldwide, but woven into the diverse tapestry of Indian culture in a uniquely poignant way. It’s a day that transcends religious boundaries, prompting reflection, empathy, and a somber acknowledgement of sacrifice. While the vibrant festivals of Diwali and Holi often paint India in brilliant colours, Good Friday offers a different hue: a quiet contemplation of the suffering and resurrection of Jesus Christ.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
