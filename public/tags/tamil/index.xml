      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;perumal-a-south-indian-manifestation-of-vishnu&#34;&gt;Perumal: A South Indian Manifestation of Vishnu&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;h3 id=&#34;introduction&#34;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Perumal, also spelled Thirumal, is a prominent name for Vishnu, the preserver deity in the Hindu Trimurti (the Hindu trinity), particularly prevalent in South Indian, specifically Tamil, traditions. Representing the sustaining force of the universe, Perumal embodies righteousness, protection, and the ultimate reality. He is revered as the source of all creation and the upholder of dharma. Perumal&amp;rsquo;s key attributes include his divine consort Lakshmi (or Sri) representing wealth and prosperity, and his association with qualities of compassion, justice, and universal love. Iconographically, Perumal is often depicted in majestic forms, adorned with precious ornaments and wielding powerful divine weapons. His significance lies in his ability to incarnate in various avatars to restore balance and guide humanity toward spiritual liberation.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
