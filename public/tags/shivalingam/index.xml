This island is considered one of the holiest pilgrimage destinations in India, holding immense spiritual importance for devotees.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;mythological-significance&#34;&gt;Mythological Significance&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;According to the epic Ramayana, Lord Rama stopped at Rameshvaram to purify himself after defeating and killing the demon king Ravana.
