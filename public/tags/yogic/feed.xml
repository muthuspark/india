      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;ayyappan-the-divine-offspring-of-shiva-and-vishnu&#34;&gt;Ayyappan: The Divine Offspring of Shiva and Vishnu&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;h3 id=&#34;introduction&#34;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Ayyappan, also known as Dharma Sasta, is a Hindu deity primarily worshipped in South India, particularly in Kerala. He is revered as the offspring of Lord Shiva and Vishnu in his female form of Mohini. Typically depicted in a yogic posture, Ayyappan represents the harmonious union of Shaivism and Vaishnavism, two major Hindu traditions. His worship is associated with principles of dharma, self-discipline, and devotion, and the pilgrimage to his principal shrine at Sabarimala is one of the largest annual pilgrimages in the world. Ayyappan&amp;rsquo;s significance in Hinduism lies in his role as a protector, a mediator, and a symbol of interfaith harmony.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
