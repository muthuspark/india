      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;kartikeya-the-god-of-war-and-divine-commander&#34;&gt;Kartikeya: The God of War and Divine Commander&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;h3 id=&#34;introduction&#34;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Kartikeya, also widely known as Murugan, Skanda, Subramanya, and several other names, is a prominent Hindu deity revered primarily as the god of war and commander-in-chief of the celestial army. He is the son of Shiva and Parvati, and a significant figure in Hindu mythology, particularly in South India, Sri Lanka, and Southeast Asia. Kartikeya is typically depicted as a youthful warrior, often riding a peacock (his vahana or vehicle), wielding a spear (vel), and embodying courage, strength, and wisdom. He is venerated as a protector, a guide, and an embodiment of divine power. His significance in Hinduism extends beyond his role as a warrior; he is seen as a symbol of overcoming obstacles, achieving self-realization, and upholding dharma (righteousness).&lt;/p&gt;</description>
