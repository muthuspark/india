&lt;h3 id="introduction"&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ganesha, also spelled Ganesh, and also known as Ganapati and Vinayaka, is one of the most widely worshipped deities in the Hindu pantheon. Recognizable by his elephant head, a large belly, and often depicted riding a mouse, Ganesha embodies wisdom, prosperity, and good fortune. He is invoked at the beginning of any new endeavor, removing obstacles and paving the way for success. Revered as the Lord of Beginnings and the Remover of Obstacles, Ganesha occupies a prominent position in Hindu religious life and cultural expressions across India and beyond.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
