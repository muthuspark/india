      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;narayana-the-primordial-waters-and-source-of-creation-in-hinduism&#34;&gt;Narayana: The Primordial Waters and Source of Creation in Hinduism&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;h3 id=&#34;introduction&#34;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Narayana is a significant deity in Hinduism, widely considered to be a form of Vishnu, one of the principal gods of the Hindu Trinity (Trimurti). He represents the cosmic waters, known as &lt;em&gt;Nara&lt;/em&gt;, and is revered as the source of all creation.  Depicted reclining on the serpent Shesha in the cosmic ocean, Narayana embodies tranquility, power, and the ultimate reality underlying the manifested universe. His iconography often includes representations of divine attributes such as the conch, discus, lotus, and mace, symbolizing his role as the sustainer and preserver of the cosmos.  Narayana holds paramount importance in Vaishnavism, where he is often considered the Supreme Being from whom all other deities emanate.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
