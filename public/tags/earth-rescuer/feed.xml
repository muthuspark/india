      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;varaha-the-boar-avatar-of-vishnu-and-rescuer-of-the-earth&#34;&gt;Varaha: The Boar Avatar of Vishnu and Rescuer of the Earth&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;h3 id=&#34;introduction&#34;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Varaha, the boar avatar of Vishnu, holds a prominent place in the Hindu pantheon. He is revered as the divine rescuer who emerged from the cosmic waters to lift the Earth goddess, Bhudevi, from the depths of the primordial ocean, saving her from the demon Hiranyaksha. Varaha represents strength, courage, and the preservation of dharma (righteousness). His iconography often depicts him as a boar-headed figure carrying Bhudevi on his tusks, symbolizing the restoration of cosmic order and the protection of the Earth. Varaha is significant in Hinduism as a reminder of Vishnu&amp;rsquo;s commitment to upholding cosmic balance and rescuing the world from chaos.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
