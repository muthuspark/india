      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;kubera-the-lord-of-wealth-in-hindu-tradition&#34;&gt;Kubera: The Lord of Wealth in Hindu Tradition&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;h3 id=&#34;introduction&#34;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Kubera, also known as Kuvera or Kuberan, is a prominent deity in the Hindu pantheon, revered as the god of wealth, prosperity, and material possessions. He is the guardian of the north direction (Dikpala) and the treasurer of the gods (Deva-kosadhyaksha). Represented as a portly figure adorned with jewels and holding a pot of gold, Kubera symbolizes both abundance and the responsible management of wealth. His worship is believed to bring financial success, fortune, and stability to devotees. Although not a prominent figure in the earliest Vedic texts, Kubera gains significant importance in later Hindu scriptures and continues to be a widely worshipped deity across various Hindu traditions.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
