      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;aryaman-the-vedic-god-of-friendship-obligations-and-lineage&#34;&gt;Aryaman: The Vedic God of Friendship, Obligations, and Lineage&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;h3 id=&#34;introduction&#34;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Aryaman is an early Vedic deity in Hinduism, often described as a solar Aditya and one of the sons of the goddess Aditi. His name signifies &amp;ldquo;bosom friend,&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;companion,&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;partner,&amp;rdquo; reflecting his role as a guardian of friendship, contracts, and societal obligations. While not as prominently featured as deities like Indra or Agni in later Hindu traditions, Aryaman holds a significant place in the Vedic pantheon, particularly as a symbol of righteous conduct and the continuity of lineage. The Milky Way is sometimes considered his path or territory.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;revanta-the-equestrian-solar-deity-of-the-hunt&#34;&gt;Revanta: The Equestrian Solar Deity of the Hunt&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;h3 id=&#34;introduction&#34;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Revanta is a relatively lesser-known, yet significant, solar deity in the Hindu pantheon. He is primarily recognized as the son of Surya, the Sun God, and his consort Saranyu.  Revanta is regarded as the patron deity of the &lt;em&gt;Adityas&lt;/em&gt;, a class of solar deities, and is particularly associated with hunting, horsemanship, and protection from dangers in the wilderness. His iconography typically depicts him as a princely figure mounted on a horse, equipped with hunting implements. Although not as widely worshipped as other major deities, Revanta holds a crucial place in understanding the multifaceted nature of solar worship and the connection between divine power and earthly pursuits in Hinduism. He is often invoked for protection, courage, and success in adventurous endeavors.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
