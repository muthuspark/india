&lt;h3 id="introduction"&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellamma, also known as Renuka, is a prominent mother goddess primarily worshipped in South India, particularly in the states of Karnataka, Maharashtra, Andhra Pradesh, and Telangana. Revered as a powerful and benevolent deity, she embodies the essence of fertility, protection, and justice. While often associated with Shaktism, the Hindu tradition focused on the worship of the Divine Feminine, Yellamma&amp;rsquo;s cult carries unique local flavors shaped by diverse cultural influences. Her iconography often depicts her as a fierce goddess, yet her devotees approach her with deep devotion, seeking her blessings for prosperity, health, and the well-being of their families. Yellamma holds a significant place in the religious landscape of South India, reflecting the enduring reverence for the divine feminine in Hinduism.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
