      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;jatayu-the-noble-eagle-of-the-ramayana&#34;&gt;Jatayu: The Noble Eagle of the Ramayana&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;h3 id=&#34;introduction&#34;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Jatayu is a revered character in Hindu mythology, primarily known for his pivotal role in the epic Ramayana. This divine eagle is celebrated for his courage, righteousness, and selfless devotion to dharma, as evidenced by his valiant attempt to rescue Sita from the clutches of Ravana. Jatayu is not worshipped as a primary deity with dedicated temples in the same way as Vishnu or Shiva, but his story is deeply ingrained in Hindu culture as a powerful symbol of bravery and the unwavering commitment to moral principles. He is often depicted as a large, majestic eagle with human-like intelligence and compassion. His significance lies in his demonstration of dharma and his ultimate sacrifice.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
