She represents the power of space and time, embodying the totality of existence. Her essence is considered the embodiment of compassion and the source of all cosmic manifestation. Bhuvaneshvari is often depicted as a regal, beautiful woman, radiating both serenity and power. Her primary attribute is the ability to create and sustain the universe with her very being. She signifies the potential of the world, the field of possibilities within which all things unfold.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
