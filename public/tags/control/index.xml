      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;hrishikesh-the-lord-of-the-senses--a-form-of-vishnu&#34;&gt;Hrishikesh: The Lord of the Senses â€“ A Form of Vishnu&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;h3 id=&#34;introduction&#34;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Hrishikesh, derived from the Sanskrit language, is a prominent name and epithet of the Hindu god Vishnu, revered as the preserver and sustainer of the universe within the Hindu Trimurti (Trinity). The name translates to &amp;ldquo;Lord of the Senses,&amp;rdquo; indicating mastery over the senses and a deep connection to inner peace and control. Hrishikesh is not typically depicted with unique iconography separate from Vishnu&amp;rsquo;s general representations; he is usually portrayed with the standard attributes of Vishnu, such as the conch (Shankha), discus (Chakra), lotus (Padma), and mace (Gada). He holds significant importance in Hinduism, particularly within Vaishnavism, as a representation of the divine power capable of guiding individuals towards liberation (moksha) through sensory control and devotion.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
