      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;shitala-the-goddess-of-healing-and-contagion-in-hinduism&#34;&gt;Shitala: The Goddess of Healing and Contagion in Hinduism&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;h3 id=&#34;introduction&#34;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Shitala (शीतला), also transliterated as Sheetala, is a revered Hindu goddess primarily associated with smallpox, chickenpox, measles, and other infectious diseases. While traditionally considered the cause of these ailments, she is simultaneously worshipped as the healer who can prevent and cure them. This duality reflects a complex understanding of disease within Hinduism, where the divine is often both the source and the solution. Shitala&amp;rsquo;s iconography typically depicts her as a graceful woman, often riding a donkey and holding a broom, a pot of cooling water, neem leaves, and sometimes a small bowl or cup. Her significance lies in her embodiment of the power to both inflict and alleviate suffering, making her a vital figure in the rural and traditional Hindu religious landscape.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
