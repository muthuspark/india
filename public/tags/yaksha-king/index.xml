He is the guardian of the north direction (Dikpala) and the treasurer of the gods (Deva-kosadhyaksha). Represented as a portly figure adorned with jewels and holding a pot of gold, Kubera symbolizes both abundance and the responsible management of wealth. His worship is believed to bring financial success, fortune, and stability to devotees.

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;vaishravana-the-lord-of-wealth-and-prosperity&#34;&gt;Vaishravana: The Lord of Wealth and Prosperity&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;h3 id=&#34;introduction&#34;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Vaishravana, widely recognized as Kubera, is a prominent deity in Hinduism, revered as the god of wealth, prosperity, and material success. He is the guardian of the north (Dikpala) and the treasurer of the gods. While not typically considered a major deity in the same echelon as Vishnu, Shiva, or Devi, Vaishravana holds a significant position within the Hindu pantheon, particularly in the context of worldly well-being and material blessings. His iconography typically portrays him as a stout figure adorned with jewels, often riding a ram or being carried in a palanquin. His significance lies in his role as a benevolent provider and a symbol of abundance, sought after by devotees seeking financial stability and success.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
