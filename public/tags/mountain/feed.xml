      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;neela-the-blue-hued-goddess&#34;&gt;Neela: The Blue-Hued Goddess&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;h3 id=&#34;introduction&#34;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Neela, meaning &amp;ldquo;blue&amp;rdquo; in Sanskrit, is a specific manifestation or form of Goddess Parvati, the consort of Lord Shiva, characterized by her blue complexion. While not always a prominently worshipped deity as a standalone figure across all Hindu traditions, Neela embodies the power and protective nature of the Divine Feminine, often associated with strength, wisdom, and the control of destructive forces. She is a representation of Parvati&amp;rsquo;s fierce and potent energy, often invoked for protection and the removal of obstacles. Her key attribute is her distinctive blue color, linking her to concepts of infinity, the sky, and the vastness of the cosmos. Neela&amp;rsquo;s significance lies in her representation of Parvati&amp;rsquo;s diverse aspects and her ability to manifest in various forms to address specific needs and circumstances.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
