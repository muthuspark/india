&lt;h3 id="introduction"&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vana Durga, meaning &amp;ldquo;Durga of the Forest,&amp;rdquo; is a specific form of the Hindu Goddess Durga primarily worshipped in wilderness settings, particularly forests and remote shrines. She represents the raw, untamed power of nature, acting as a guardian of the forest and its inhabitants. While sharing the fundamental attributes of Durga, she embodies a more primal and immediate connection to the natural world. Her worship emphasizes her role as a protector against dangers, both physical and spiritual, encountered in the wild. Key attributes include her fierce appearance, her connection to nature, and her role as a powerful protector. Iconographically, she is often depicted holding weapons and riding a lion or other animal associated with the forest. Vana Durga holds significant importance in Hinduism, particularly within Shaktism, as a manifestation of the divine feminine power (Shakti) residing within the natural world.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
