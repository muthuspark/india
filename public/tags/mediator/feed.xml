      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;shantadurga-the-peaceful-form-of-durga&#34;&gt;Shantadurga: The Peaceful Form of Durga&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;h3 id=&#34;introduction&#34;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Shantadurga, also known as Santeri, is a prominent Hindu goddess primarily worshipped in Goa, India. She represents a unique synthesis of power (Shakti) and peace (Shanti), embodying a form of Durga who pacifies conflict and restores harmony. Unlike the often fierce and warrior-like depictions of Durga in other regions, Shantadurga is typically represented in a serene and benevolent form, often associated with motherhood and protection. She is revered as a powerful yet compassionate deity, a protector of her devotees and a symbol of reconciliation.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
