      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;maharashtra-day-celebrating-the-soul-of-maharashtra-one-bite-of-puran-poli-at-a-time&#34;&gt;Maharashtra Day: Celebrating the Soul of Maharashtra, One Bite of Puran Poli at a Time&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Ever heard of a day dedicated to the spirit of a land? In India, where every corner pulsates with vibrant culture and history, we have many! But today, we&amp;rsquo;re zeroing in on one particularly special occasion: Maharashtra Day, celebrated every year on May 1st. More than just a state holiday, Maharashtra Day, or &lt;em&gt;Maharashtra Diwas&lt;/em&gt; as it&amp;rsquo;s lovingly called, is a powerful reminder of our shared identity, a celebration of our rich heritage, and a day filled with pride for all Maharashtrians, both at home and abroad.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
